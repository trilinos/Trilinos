                 this interface, numerical optimization algorithms can be
                 designed to take advantage of inherent problem features like
                 the splitting of the variables into states and controls
                 and the scaling inherited from the functional scalar
                 products. Further, the interface allows the optimization
                 algorithm to make efficient use of user-provided function
                 evaluations and derivative calculations.",

                 schemes for initial-boundary value problems.  The C++ class fdtd
                 takes a complete specification of a single step, along with some
                 associated code, and assembles from it a complete simulator,
                 along with the linearized and adjoint simulations.  The result is
                 a (nonlinear) operator in the sense of the Hilbert Class Library
                 (HCL), a C++ software package for optimization.  The HCL operator so
                 produced links directly with any of the HCL optimization algorithms.
                 Moreover, the performance of simulators constructed in this way is
                 equivalent to that of optimized Fortran implementations.",
