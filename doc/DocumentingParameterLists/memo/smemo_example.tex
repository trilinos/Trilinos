% This is an example LaTeX file which demonstrates the use of the
% smemo class file, designed to resemble the official Sandia memo
% format. Most of the text here is taken directly from Rolf's SAND
% report examples.
%
% I believe the class file was started ~10 years ago in 1520 by Mark
% Blanford. It was rewritten in October of 2004 by a contractor (see
% sfonts.sty for contact information). I (Rich Field) have made a few
% very minor changes since then.

% The following can be used to mark "OUO" on the top and bottom of

\subject{On the Use of Dry Erase Markers at National Laboratories}

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %
%
% Main text of memo begins here
%
It would appear that many projects carried out at the national DOE
laboratories could benefit from some dry erase markers. This report examines the
requirements for the use of dry erase markers and gives a few specific examples on
how dry erase markers can be used to advance the state of the art.

\section{Introduction}\label{Intro}
In~\cite{Potter} we have shown that dry erase markers have
a use in science. In this report we address the use of dry
erase markers specifically to the science and engineering
performed at the DOE national laboratories. Let us begin
with a description of a couple of basic dry erase marker
drawings. We use the circle and the square to make our point.

\subsection{The Circle}
	    Figure~\ref{fig1} shows one of the basic shapes. It
	    appears in many dry erase drawings and has many important
	    properties.

	    \begin{figure}[ht]
		\centering
		\begin{picture}(50,50)(0,0)
		    \put(25,25){\circle{50}}
		    \put(25,25){\circle{1}}
		\end{picture}
		\caption[The circle]{A circle is one of the basic
		    shapes.  It has many important properties. Note,
		    for example, that every point along its
		    circumference is at exactly the same distance
		    from the center. A truly important property
		    for a cicrle.}
		\label{fig1}
	    \end{figure}

	    Whole books have been written about the circle and
	    similar, lesser shapes. So, it would be presumptuous to
	    attempt to even list some of its properties and uses
	    in dry erase marker drawings. Simply admire the shape
	    in Figure~\ref{fig1} and its power will soon engulf
	    you in ideas and beautiful feelings of completeness.



\subsubsection{Small Circles}
We also need an example of a subsubsection to make sure titles and
table of content entries work for those.

And while we are at it, we might as well check paragraph
spacing. Although, we will do that again in Section~\ref{sec:long}.

\subsection{The Square}
Figure~\ref{fig2} illustrates another famous shape. We will
show some of its uses in later chapters, but we wanted to introduce it
here because this is a good place for another figure.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{picture}(50,50)(0,0)
    \put(0,0){\framebox(50,50){}}
    \put(25,25){\circle{1}}
  \end{picture}
  \caption[The square]{A square is another of the basic
    shapes. It is not quite as powerful as the circle. It
    has some similarities (note that the four corners all have
    the same distance to the center), and has many fine
    uses in everyday dry erase marker drawing.}
  \label{fig2}
\end{figure}

\subsection{The Dot}
We also need a figure with a short caption. In order to do this,
we introduce the dot. Figure~\ref{fig3} shows the shape of a dot.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{picture}(50,50)(0,0)
    \put(25,25){\circle{1}}
  \end{picture}
  \caption[The dot]{A simple dot}
  \label{fig3}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Tables and Such}
In order to test our class file, we also need to have some tables. One
should be enough for our purposes, so here it is: Table~\ref{tab1}. On
second thought, we need another one to test the list of tables with
multiple entries. So, we introduce Table~\ref{tab2}.

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption[Shapes]{This superb table lists a few
    of the more important shapes and some of
    their properties. Be aware that this condensed list
    can by no means describe all the properties or
    shapes drawable by dry erase markers.}
  \bigskip

  \begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|c|}
    \hline \hline
    Name  & Number of & Importance & Shape \\
    & corners   &            &       \\
    \hline
    circle & 0        & high       & $\bigcirc$ \\
    square & 4        & medium     & $\diamond$ \\
    triangle & 3      & low        & $\triangle$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab1}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[ht]
  \centering
  \caption{A magic square}
  \bigskip
  
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    1 & 15 & 14 & 4 \\ \hline
    12 & 6 & 7 & 9 \\ \hline
    8 & 10 & 11 & 5 \\ \hline
    13 & 3 & 2 & 16 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \label{tab2}
\end{table}

\section{A Section With Subfigures}
The subfigure package used to cause problems until James Gruetzner and
Todd Pitts found out that the subfigure package uses {\tt
  addcontentsline}, which is redefined in the SANDreport class. The
class uses the ifthen package, but it is not loaded at the time the
subfigure package uses {\tt addcontentsline}.  The new code avoids
using the ifthen package.  Have a look at Figure~\ref{fig:creatures} 
for an example.

\begin{figure}[!btp]
  \centering
  %\subfigure[A Hyppogriff]{
    %\label{fig:sub:intro:creatures:hippogriff}
    %\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true, width=2.0in]{hippogriff}
  %}
  %\subfigure[A Dragon]{
    %\label{fig:sub:intro:creatures:dragon}
    %\includegraphics[keepaspectratio=true, width=2.0in]{dragon}
  %}
  \caption{Creatures not drawn using dry erase markers.}
  \label{fig:creatures}
\end{figure}

\section{A Long Section}\label{sec:long}
We need a long chapter to test full-page formatting. Therefore, we
switch to the ancient language of Latin.

\section{Conclusions}
Of course, no report would be complete without some conclusions.
This section is where they would go, if we had some.

\section{Historical Perspective}
This is an example of an appendix.

\subsection{The Past a Long Time Ago}
This is where we talk about things so old nobody can verify them. We
are safe. 

\subsection{The Past More Recently}
Now we have to be a little bit more careful, since records exist from
that time, and some people still alive actually lived back then.

\section{Some Other Appendix}
Just to show what a second Appendix would look like. It contains
a table.
