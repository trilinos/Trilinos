\begin{abstract}

The Trilinos Project is an effort to facilitate the design, development,
integration and ongoing support of mathematical software libraries.
A new software capability is introduced into Trilinos as a {\it
package}.  A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by
a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as
algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc.

The Trilinos Users Guide is a resource for new and existing
Trilinos users.  Topics covered include how to configure and 
build Trilinos, what is required to integrate an existing package into Trilinos
and examples of how those requirements can be met, as well as what
tools and services are 
available to Trilinos packages.  Also discussed are some common practices that 
are followed by many Trilinos package developers.  Finally, a snapshot
of current Trilinos packages and their interoperability status
is provided, along with a list of supported computer platforms.

\section{Introduction}
\label{Section:Introduction}
The Trilinos Project is an effort to facilitate the design, development,
integration and ongoing support of mathematical software libraries.  Trilinos 
also provides a set of core utility libraries
that provide common vector, graph and matrix capabilities, as well as
a common abstract interface for applications to access any appropriate
Trilinos package.

The overall objective of Trilinos is to promote rapid development and
deployment of high-quality, state-of-the-art mathematical software in
an environment that supports interoperability of packages while
preserving package independence. 

The Trilinos Users Guide is meant to assist new and existing
Trilinos users.  Topics covered include how to configure, build, and install
Trilinos, as well as how to run tests to insure proper installation.  In 
addition, issue reporting and how to sign up for and use Trilinos mail lists 
are discussed.  Finally, directions for obtaining Trilinos itself and 
documentation for individual Trilinos packages are provided.

%LIST OF POSSIBLE TOPICS: How to run tests,
%how to submit bug rpt, how to use mail lists - also list mail lists that 
%users are interested in.  Brief description of packages, point to package
%documentation.  How to obtain Trilinos.

For a higher-level view of the Trilinos project, please see An Overview
of Trilinos~\cite{Trilinos-Overview}.  The Trilinos Tutorial is useful
resource for new and existing Trilinos users~\cite{Trilinos-Tutorial}.  A
document is also available specifically for Trilinos developers; please see
the Trilinos Developers Guide~\cite{Trilinos-Dev-Guide}.  The Developers
Guide contains both tutorial and general reference material.

\section{Getting Started}
\label{Section:GettingStarted}
\begin{minipage}[c]{\textwidth}
\begin{minipage}[l]{.4\textwidth}

This chapter covers some of the basics that a user will need to know when 
beginning to use Trilinos.  Specifically, we address how to obtain, 
configure, build, install and test Trilinos.  We will also discuss how to
link to Trilinos libraries.
Although this user guide is current at the time of printing, the 
Trilinos Project is under active development.  For the most up-to-date information, 
please visit the online Trilinos Home Page.  The most accurate and complete information
will be kept at this site.
\end{minipage}\hfill
\framebox{\begin{minipage}[r]{.55\textwidth}{
{\bf Tip:}
Check out the Trilinos Home Page at 
\InlineDirectory{http://software.sandia.gov/Trilinos.}
At the website a user can: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Find up-to-date information about Trilinos and its packages.
\item Download Trilinos.
\item Sign up for mail lists.
\item Find documentation.
\item Submit a bug report.
\end{itemize}
}\end{minipage}}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Obtaining a Copy of Trilinos}

Trilinos can be obtained in two different ways.  Users outside of Sandia
most commonly 
download Trilinos in the form of a tarball from the Trilinos website at 
\newline \InlineDirectory{http://software.sandia.gov/trilinos/downloads.html}.
On most systems, the following commands can be used to expand the tarball:
\DisplayCommand{gunzip trilinos-7.0.5.tar.gz}
\DisplayCommand{tar xf trilinos-7.0.5.tar}
For versions of Trilinos other than 7.0.5, the file names in the above
commands will need to be adjusted.

Users who download the tarball from the website may skip to 
Section~\ref{subsect:BuildDirectoryStructure}. 

Users may be able to obtain a 
copy of Trilinos via the Trilinos CVS repository.  Access to the Trilinos 
repository is granted only to co-developers, Sandians, and in select 
special cases.

To access the repository, an account on software.sandia.gov is required.  In 
addition, the user account must be a in the ``cvs'' group 
on software.sandia.gov.  To request an account, send a note 
to \InlineDirectory{trilinos-help@software.sandia.gov}.  
The following two environment variables must be set to access the repository:

\DisplayCommand{CVSROOT :ext:your\_user\_name@software.sandia.gov:/space/CVS}
\DisplayCommand{CVS\_RSH ssh}

Replace ``your\_user\_name'' with your user name on software.sandia.gov.

To checkout a working copy of the development branch of Trilinos in the 
current directory, type

\DisplayCommand{cvs checkout Trilinos}

To checkout a working copy of a release branch of Trilinos in the current 
directory, type

\DisplayCommand{cvs checkout -r name\_of\_release\_branch Trilinos}

Replace ``name\_of\_release\_branch'' with the name of the release branch.
The name of the current release branch can be obtained by sending a note to
\newline \InlineDirectory{trilinos-help@software.sandia.gov}.

To checkout a working copy of the development version of only one Trilinos 
package in the current directory, type

\DisplayCommand{cvs checkout <package\_name>}

Replace ``package\_name'' with the name of the package.  Please note 
that most packages have dependencies on other Trilinos packages.

If the machine that is downloading Trilinos from software.sandia.gov has gzip
available, it is possible to speed up the checkout proces using the -z 
option.  For example, to checkout all of Trilinos using the most aggressive
compression, type

\DisplayCommand{cvs -z 9 checkout Trilinos}

For those not familiar with CVS, a brief discussion covering some of the most 
common CVS commands is available in Section~\ref{Section:CVS}.  For a more 
complete listing of CVS commands, see the GNU CVS Home Page~\cite{CVS}.

\subsection{Testing the Build}
\label{subsect:TestHarness}

Trilinos contains a script that can be used for the purpose of 
verification testing. Unfortunately, the process is currently tailored to 
fit the needs of developers.  The Trilinos team is in the process of
creating a verification process that is more suitable for users.  For 
instructions on how to use the current process, go to 

\InlineDirectory{http://software.sandia.gov/trilinos/developer/test\_harness.html} 

and look at the section entitled ``Running the Test Harness Locally''.

A simple alternative that provides a quick santity check is to execute one
or more Trilinos tests manually.  For example, if Epetra was one of the 
packages that was configured and built in the LINUX\_MPI build tree, the 
Epetra tests were not disabled through the use of configure options, and
lam mpi is installed, perform 
the following series of steps to run the CrsMatrix tests:

\begin{verbatim}
	cd Trilinos/LINUX_MPI/packages/epetra/test/CrsMatrix
	lamboot
	mpirun -np 3 ./CrsMatrix_test.exe
	echo $status
	lamhalt
\end{verbatim}

For a serial build, the process is shorter:

\begin{verbatim}
	cd Trilinos/LINUX_SERIAL/packages/epetra/test/CrsMatrix
	./CrsMatrix_test.exe
	echo $status
\end{verbatim}

In either case, the status returned will be zero if the tests passed, nonzero
if the tests failed.  Epetra has many other tests in subdirectories that are 
peers to the CrsMatrix directory listed above.  There are also examples that
are located in the example 
directory that is a peer to the test directory.  Most other packages have a 
number of tests and or examples that can be run using the same basic process. 

 
\section{Ongoing Use and Support}
\label{Section:UseSupport}
In this section we discuss how to report issues (bugs) and how to sign up
for mail lists.

\subsection{Reporting Bugs}
\label{subsect:Bugzilla}
Feature and issue reports are tracked using Bugzilla~\cite{Bugzilla}.  
Bugzilla can be found on the web at 
\InlineDirectory{http://software.sandia.gov/bugzilla}.  
A Bugzilla account is necessary for submitting bugs.  Those interested can 
sign up at the website.  All bugs related to any Trilinos package that uses 
Bugzilla should be submitted to Bugzilla.  A secondary method of submitting
bug reports is to send a note 
to \InlineDirectory{Trilinos-Bugs@software.sandia.gov}.  

Regardless of how an issue is submitted, the bug report should be filled out 
with as much detail as possible.  Specifically, be sure to include which 
version of Trilinos the bug was discovered in and which 
platform(s) and compiler(s) the bug is associated with.  Also include any 
specific error messages and any additional information that can be provided.

Two commonly underutilized features of Bugzilla are the ability to assign a
priority and a severity to a bug.  Taking advantage of these features helps
users more clearly express their concerns and helps developers organize tasks.
Below are recommended usage guidelines for the priority and severity settings
for Bugzilla bugs that are filed against Trilinos.
                                                                                
Severity: Severity should be determined by the person who files the bug
(reporter) and should be based solely on how “severe” the reporter perceives
the bug to be at the time the bug is filed.  Considerations for selecting a
proper severity include whether or not the bug is currently directly impeding
progress, and if it has the potential to impede progress in the future.  There
is also an important distinction between enhancements and faults in existing
functionality.  Severity can be updated if conditions warrant a change.
Possible severity settings include blocker, critical, major, normal, minor,
trivial, and enhancement.  The severity of a bug is not necessarily related to
its priority.

Priority: Priority should be determined by the owner of the bug.  Priority can
be chosen based on the relative importance of other existing bugs, as well as
on how important the bug is to Trilinos and Sandia.  When filling out a bug 
report, users can leave the bug at the default priority, or may try to guess
the priority that the bug owner will select.

NOTE: In the context of Bugzilla, ``bug'' can refer not only to an error in 
existing code, but also to a desired enhancement.  For example, a bug report 
should be submitted to Bugzilla to report a segmentation fault that occurs 
when using an existing Ifpack preconditioner, and a bug report should also be
submitted to request a new Ifpack preconditioner.  ``Issue'' and ``bug'' are 
used interchangeably in this discussion of Bugzilla.

\subsection{Signing Up for Mail Lists}
\label{subsect:MailMan}
Email lists are maintained for Trilinos as a whole and for each package 
through Mailman~\cite{Mailman}.  This tool can be found on the web at 
\newline
\InlineDirectory{http://software.sandia.gov/mailman/listinfo}.  
Those interested in signing 
up for one or more lists may do so at the website.  A digest mode is 
available for those who wish to receive a daily summary of list activity.  
Non-Sandians are able to sign up for the ``Users'' and ``Announce'' 
lists.  Sandians should keep this in mind when posting to these lists.

\begin{minipage}[c]{\textwidth}
\begin{minipage}[l]{.6\textwidth}
The example mailing lists mentioned below are to be used 
for issues relating to all of Trilinos.  The names for the lists pertaining to 
individual packages follow the same naming scheme, simply replace ``Trilinos'' 
with the name of the package.  For example the list for Trilinos users is 
called Trilinos-Users and the email address is 
\InlineCommand{trilinos-users@software.sandia.gov}  The list 
for Epetra users is called Epetra-Users and the associated email address is 
\InlineCommand{epetra-users@software.sandia.gov}
\end{minipage}\hfill
\framebox{\begin{minipage}[r]{.35\textwidth}{
{\bf Tip:}
While those who use any individual Trilinos package are also
``Trilinos users'', the lists are not set up to recognize this.  In other 
words, those who subscribe to the Epetra-Users mailing list do not necessarily 
form a subset of those who subscribe to the Trilinos-Users mailing list.  This 
is also true of all other list types.  Keep this in mind when subscribing and 
posting to lists.

\section{Commonly Used CVS Commands}
\label{Section:CVS}
To access the Trilinos CVS repository, an account on software.sandia.gov is 
required.  To request an account, send a note to 
\InlineCommand{trilinos-help@software.sandia.gov}.  
The following two 
environment variables must be set to access the repository:

\DisplayCommand{CVSROOT :ext:your\_user\_name@software.sandia.gov:/space/CVS}
\DisplayCommand{CVS\_RSH ssh}

(Replace ``your\_user\_name'' with your user name on software.sandia.gov.)

Below is a brief description of the CVS commands that are most commonly 
used by Trilinos users.  For a 
more complete listing of CVS commands, see the GNU CVS Home Page~\cite{CVS}.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Checking Out a Working Copy:}
To checkout a working copy of the development branch of Trilinos in the 
current directory from the CVS repository, type

\DisplayCommand{cvs checkout Trilinos}

To checkout a working copy of only one package of Trilinos in the 
current directory, type

\DisplayCommand{cvs checkout <package\_name>}

(Replace ``package\_name'' with the name of the package.

To checkout a different branch or a tagged version of Trilinos, type

\DisplayCommand{cvs checkout -r <name\_of\_branch\_or\_tag> Trilinos}

\item {\bf Updating a Working Copy:}
To update after a version has been obtained use the \InlineCommand{cvs update} 
command.  First, cd to the directory that is to be updated (often the 
Trilinos root directory).  Then type:

\DisplayCommand{cvs -q update -dP}

The ``-q'' option means ``be somewhat quiet''.  Try an update without the 
``-q'' to see exactly what the option does.  

The ``-d'' option means to get any new directories.  For example, if a new 
package is added to the repository, but the ``-d'' option is not used, that 
new package will never appear in the working copy.  However, the first time 
that the ``-d'' option is used, all of the new package directories will be 
downloaded, and from that time on, all CVS updates will update the 
directories that were downloaded.  It is good practice to include this 
option for every CVS update.

Finally the ``-P'' option ``prunes'' empty directories.  This helps to keep 
the directory structure from getting more cluttered than it needs to.  For 
example, the old ``petra'' and ``tsf'' packages were removed from the 
repository, but the directory structures will remain if this option is not 
specified.  If an empty directory is needed, simply issue one update 
command without the ``-P'' and the empty directories will be restored.

%cvs status
