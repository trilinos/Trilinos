\section{Working with Epetra Matrices}
\label{chap:epetra_mat}

Epetra contains several matrix classes.  Epetra matrices can be defined
to be either {\em serial} or {\em distributed}. A serial matrix could be
the matrix corresponding to a given element in a finite-element
discretization, or the Hessemberg matrix in the GMRES method. Those
matrices are of (relatively) small size, so that it is not convenient to
distribute them across the processes.

Other matrices, like for instance the linear system matrices for
large-scale computing, must be distributed to obtain scalability.  For
distributed sparse matrices, the basic Epetra class is
Epetra\_RowMatrix, meant for double-precision matrices with row access.
Epetra\_RowMatrix is a pure virtual class.  Various classes are derived
\verb!Epetra_RowMatrix!. Among them, here we recall:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb!Epetra_CrsMatrix! for point matrices;
\item \verb!Epetra_VbrMatrix! for block matrices (that is, for
  matrices which have a block structure, for example the ones deriving
  from the discretization of a PDE problem with multiple unknowns for
  node);
\item \verb!Epetra_FECrsMatrix! and \verb!Epetra_FEVbrMatrix! for
  matrices arising from FE discretizations.
\end{itemize}

This Chapter will show the fundamental Trilinos capabilities to work
with matrices. During the Chapter, the user will be introduced to:
\begin{itemize}
\item The creation of (serial) dense matrices (in Section~\ref{sec:dense_mat});
\item The creation of sparse point matrices (in Section~\ref{sec:sparse_mat});
\item The creation of sparse block matrices (in Section~\ref{sec:sparse_vbr});
\item The insertion of non-local elements using finite-element matrices
  (in Section~\ref{sec:fematrix}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Serial Dense Matrices}
\label{sec:dense_mat}

Epetra provides functionalities for sequential dense matrices with the
class Epetra\_SerialDenseMatrix.  A possible way to create a serial
dense matrix \verb!D! of dimension \verb!n!  by \verb!m! is
\begin{verbatim}
#include "Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix.h"
Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix D(n,m);
\end{verbatim}
One could also create a zero-size object, 
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix D();
\end{verbatim}
and then shape this object:
\begin{verbatim}
D.Shape(n,m);
\end{verbatim}
({\tt D} could be reshaped using \verb!ReShape()!.)

Epetra\_SerialDenseMatrix are stored in a column-major order in the
usual FORTRAN style. This class is built on the top of the BLAS library,
and is derived from Epetra\_Blas (not covered in this tutorial).
Epetra\_SerialDenseMatrix is intended to provide a very basic support
for dense rectangular matrices.

\smallskip

To access the matrix element at the i-th row and the j-th column, it is
possible to use the parenthesis operator (\verb!A(i,j)!), or the bracket
operator (\verb!A[j][i]!, note that i and j are reversed)\footnote{The
  bracket approach is in general faster, as the compiler can inline the
  corresponding function. Instead, some compiler have problems to inline
  the parenthesis operator.}.

As an example of the use of this class, in the following code we
consider a matrix-matrix product between two rectangular matrices
\verb!A! and \verb!B!. 
\begin{verbatim}
int NumRowsA = 2, NumColsA = 2;
int NumRowsB = 2, NumColsB = 1;
Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix A, B;
A.Shape( NumRowsA, NumColsA );
B.Shape(NumRowsB, NumColsB);
// ... here set the elements of A and B
Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix AtimesB;
AtimesB.Shape(NumRowsA,NumColsB);  
double alpha = 1.0, beta = 1.0;
AtimesB.Multiply('N','N',alpha, A, B, beta);
cout << AtimesB;
\end{verbatim}
\verb!Multiply()! performs the operation $C = \alpha A^{opA} + \beta
B^{opA}$, where $A$ replaced by $A^T$ if the first input parameter is
\verb!T!, and $B$ replaced by $B^T$ if the second input parameter is
\verb!T!.  The complete code is reported in file
\TriExe{epetra/ex10.cpp}.

\smallskip

To solve a linear system with a dense matrix, one has to create an
Epetra\_SerialDenseSolver. This class uses the most sophisticated
techniques available in the LAPACK library. The class is built on the
top of BLAS and LAPACK, and thus has excellent performances and
numerical capabilities\footnote{Another package, Teuchos, covered in
  Chapter~\ref{chap:teuchos}, allows a templated access to LAPACK.
  ScaLAPACK are supported through Amesos, see
  Chapter~\ref{chap:amesos}.}.

The primary difference is that Epetra\_LAPACK is a ``thin'' layer on the
top of LAPACK, while Epetra\_SerialDenseSolver attempts to provide easy
access to the more sophisticated aspects of solving dense linear
systems.

As a general rule, we can say that Epetra\_LAPACK should be preferred
when the user is looking for a convenient wrapper around the FORTRAN
LAPACK routines, and the problem at hand is well-conditioned. Instead,
when the user wants (or potentially wants to) solve ill-conditioned
problems or want to work with a more object-oriented interface, he/she
will probably use Epetra\_SerialDenseMatrix.

\smallskip

Given an Epetra\_SerialDenseMatrix and two Epetra\_DSerialDenseVectors
{\tt x} and {\tt b}, the general approach is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_SerialDenseSolver Solver();
Solver.SetMatrix(D);
Solver.SetVectors(x,b);
\end{verbatim}
Then, it is possible to invert the matrix with \verb!Invert()!, solve
the linear system with \verb!Solve()!, apply iterative refinement with
\verb!ApplyRefinement()!. Other methods are available; for instance,
\begin{verbatim}
double rcond=Solve.RCOND();
\end{verbatim}
returns the reciprocal of the condition number of matrix {\tt D} (or -1
if not computed).

File \TriExe{epetra/ex11.cpp} outlines some of the capabilities of the
Epetra\_SerialDenseSolver class.

\subsection{Distributed Sparse Matrices}
\label{sec:sparse_mat}

Epetra provides an extensive set of classes to create and fill
distributed sparse matrices. These classes allow row-by-row or
element-by-element constructions. Support is provided for common matrix
operations, as scaling, norm, matrix-vector multiplication and
matrix-multivector multiplication\footnote{Methods for matrix-matrix
  products are avaiable through the EpetraExt package. Another
  alternative is to use the efficient matrix-matrix product of ML, which
  requires ML\_Operator objects. One may use light-weight conversions to
  ML\_Operator, perform the ML matrix-matrix product, then convert the
  result to Epetra Matrix.}.

Using Epetra objects, applications do not need to know about the
particular storage format, and other implementation details such as data
layout, number and location of ghost nodes. Epetra furnishes two basic
formats, one suited for point matrices, the other for block matrices.
The former is presented in this Section; the latter, generally much more
efficient for problems with multiple degree of freedom per node, is
introduced in Section~\ref{sec:sparse_vbr}. If required, other matrix
formats can be introduced by deriving the Epetra\_RowMatrix virtual
class.

\begin{remark}
Some numerical algorithms require  the application of the linear
operator only. For this reason, some applications find convenient to not
store a given matrix. Epetra can handle this situation using with the
Epetra\_Operator class; see Section~\ref{sec:operator}.
\end{remark}

The process of creating a sparse matrix is more involved with respect to
that of dense matrices. This is because, in order to obtain excellent
numerical performances, one has to provide an estimation of the nonzero
elements on each row of the sparse matrix. (Recall that dynamic
allocation of new memory and copying the old storage into the new one is
an expensive operation.) 

As a general rule, the process of constructing a (distributed) sparse
matrix is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item allocate an integer array \verb!Nnz!, whose length equals the
  number of local rows;
\item loop over the local rows, and estimate the number of nonzero
  elements of that row;
\item create the sparse matrix using \verb!Nnz!;
\item fill the sparse matrix.
\end{itemize}

As an example, in this Section we will present how to construct a
distributed (sparse) matrix, arising from a finite-difference solution
of a one-dimensional Laplace problem. This matrix looks like:
\begin{equation*}
A = \begin{pmatrix}
 2 & -1 &     &   &    \\
-1 &  2     & -1     &        &    \\
   & \ldots & \ldots & \ldots & -1 \\
   &        &        & -1     & 2
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
The example illustrates how to construct the matrix,
and how to perform matrix-vector operations.
The code can be found in \TriExe{epetra/ex12.cpp}.

We start by specifying the global dimension (here is 5, but can be any
number):
\begin{verbatim}
int NumGlobalElements = 5;
\end{verbatim}
We create a map (for the sake of simplicity linear), and define the
local number of rows and the global numbering for each local row:
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_Map Map(NumGlobalElements,0,Comm);
int NumMyElements = Map.NumMyElements();
int * MyGlobalElements = Map.MyGlobalElements( );
\end{verbatim}
In particular, we have that \verb!j=MyGlobalElements[i]! is the global
numbering for local node \verb!i!.  Then, we have to specify the number
of nonzeros per row. In general, this can be done in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
\item Furnish an integer value, representing the number of nonzero
  element on each row (the same value for all the rows);
\item Furnish an integer vector \verb!NumNz!, of length
  \verb!NumMyElements()!, containing the nonzero elements of each row.
\end{itemize}

The first approach is trivial: the matrix is create with the simple
instruction
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_CrsMatrix A(Copy,Map,3);
\end{verbatim}
(Note the \verb!Copy! keyword, see Section~\ref{sec:distr_vec}.) In this
case, Epetra considers the number 3 as a ``suggestion,'' in the sense
that the user can still add more than 3 elements per row (at the price
of a possible performance decay).  The second approach can be coded as
follows:
\begin{verbatim}
int * NumNz = new int[NumMyElements];
for( int i=0 ; i<NumMyElements ; i++ )
if( MyGlobalElements[i]==0 || 
    MyGlobalElements[i] == NumGlobalElements-1)
  NumNz[i] = 2;
else
  NumNz[i] = 3;
\end{verbatim}
We are building a tridiagonal matrix where each row has (-1 2 -1).  Here
\verb!NumNz[i]! is the Number of nonzero terms in the i-th global
equation on this process (2 off-diagonal terms (except for the first and
last equation).

Now, we create an Epetra\_CsrMatrix as
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_CrsMatrix A(Copy,Map,NumNz);
\end{verbatim}
and we add rows one-at-a-time. \verb!A! has been created in Copy mode,
and relies on the specified map. To fill its values, we need some
additional variables: let us call them \verb!Indexes! and \verb!Values!.
Those variables will contain the global column number and the values of
the nonzeros for each row.
\begin{verbatim}
double *Values = new double[2];
Values[0] = -1.0; Values[1] = -1.0;
int *Indices = new int[2];
double two = 2.0;
int NumEntries;

for( int i=0 ; i<NumMyElements; ++i ) {
  if (MyGlobalElements[i]==0) {
      Indices[0] = 1;
      NumEntries = 1;
  } else if (MyGlobalElements[i] == NumGlobalElements-1) {
    Indices[0] = NumGlobalElements-2;
    NumEntries = 1;
  } else {
    Indices[0] = MyGlobalElements[i]-1;
    Indices[1] = MyGlobalElements[i]+1;
    NumEntries = 2;
  }
  A.InsertGlobalValues(MyGlobalElements[i], NumEntries, 
                       Values, Indices);
  // Put in the diagonal entry
  A.InsertGlobalValues(MyGlobalElements[i], 1, &two, 
                       MyGlobalElements+i);
}
\end{verbatim}
Note that column indexes have been inserted using global indexes (but a
method called \verb!InsertMyValues! can be used as well) .  As a final
operation, we can transform the matrix into local indexes. This phase in
required in order to perform efficient parallel matrix-vector products
and other matrix operations.
\begin{verbatim}
A.FillComplete();
\end{verbatim}
This call to \verb!FillComplete()! will reorganize the internally stored
data so that each process knows the set of internal, border and external
elements. Also, the communication pattern is established. As we have
specified just one map, Epetra considers that the the rows of $A$ are
distributed among the processes in the same way of the elements of $X$
and $B$.  Although very common, this approach is only a particular case.
Epetra allows the user to handle the more general case of a matrix
defined using a Map, is different from that of $X$ and that of $B$. In
fact, each Epetra matrix is defined by {\sl four} maps:
\begin{itemize}
\item Two maps, called RowMap and ColumnMap, are used to determine the
  set of rows and the columns of the elements assigned to a given
  processor. In general, one processor cannot set elements assigned to
  other processors\footnote{Some classes, derived from the
    Epetra\_RowMatrix, can perform data exchange; see for instance
    Epetra\_FECrsMatrix or Epetra\_FEVbrMatrix.}. RowMap and ColumnMap
  determine the pattern of the matrix, as it is used during the
  construction. They can be obtained using the methods
  \verb!RowMatrixRowMap()!  and \verb!RowMatrixColMap()! of the
  Epetra\_RowMatrix class. Usually, the user dos not specify a
  ColumnMap, which is automatically created by Epetra.  RowMap and
  ColumnMap can differ.
\item DomainMap and RangeMap define, instead, the parallel data layout
  of $X$ and $B$, respectively. Note that those two maps can completely
  different from RowMap and ColumnMap, meaning that a matrix can be
  constructed using a certain data distribution, then used on vectors
  with another data distribution. DomainMap and RangeMap can
  differ. Those tow maps can be obtained using the methods
  \verb!DomainMap()! and \verb!RangeMap()!.
\end{itemize}
The potentialities of this approach are better explained using an
example, reported in the example file \TriExe{epetra/ex24.cpp}. In this
example, to be run using two processors, we build up two maps:
\verb!MapA! will be used to construct the matrix, while \verb!MapB! to
define the parallel layout of the vectors $X$ and $B$. For the sake of
simplicity, $A$ is diagonal.
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_CrsMatrix A(Copy,MapA,MapA,1);
\end{verbatim}
As usual in this Tutorial, the integer vector \verb!MyGlobalElementsA!
contains the global ID of local nodes. To assemble $A$, we cycle over
all the local rows (defined by \verb!MapA!):
\begin{verbatim}
for( int i=0 ; i<NumElementsA ; ++i ) {
  double one = 2.0;
  int indices = MyGlobalElementsA[i];
  A.InsertGlobalValues(MyGlobalElementsA[i], 1, &one, &indices );
}
\end{verbatim}
Now, as both $X$ and $B$ are defined using \verb!MapB!, instead of
calling \verb!FillComplete()!, we do
\begin{verbatim}
A.FillComplete(MapB,MapB);
\end{verbatim}
Now, we can create $X$ and $B$ as vectors based on \verb!MapB!, and
perform the matrix-vector product:
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_Vector VecB(MapB);   Epetra_Vector VecB2(MapB);  
A.Multiply(false,VecB,VecB2);
\end{verbatim}  

\begin{remark}
Although presented for Epetra\_CrsMatrix objects, the distinction
between RowMap, ColMap, DomainMap, and RangeMap is valid for all classed
derived from Epetra\_RowMatrix. 
\end{remark}

Example \TriExe{epetra/ex14.cpp} shows the use of some of the methods of 
the Epetra\_CrsMatrix class. The code prints out several information
about the structure of the matrix, and some of its properties.
The output will be approximatively as here reported:
\begin{verbatim}
[msala:epetra]> mpirun -np 2 ./ex14
*** general Information about the matrix
Number of Global Rows = 5
Number of Global Cols = 5
is the matrix square  = yes
||A||_\infty          = 4
||A||_1               = 4
||A||_F               = 5.2915
Number of nonzero diagonal entries = 5( 100 %)
Nonzero per row : min = 2 average = 2.6 max = 3
Maximum number of nonzero elements/row = 3
min( a_{i,j} )      = -1
max( a_{i,j} )      = 2
min( abs(a_{i,j}) ) = 1
max( abs(a_{i,j}) ) = 2
Number of diagonal dominant rows        = 2 (40 % of total)
Number of weakly diagonal dominant rows = 3 (60 % of total)
*** Information about the Trilinos storage

are indices global         = no
is matrix lower triangular = no
is matrix upper triangular = no
are there diagonal entries = yes
is matrix sorted           = yes
\end{verbatim}

Other examples are reported for Epetra\_CrsMatrix:
\begin{itemize}
\item Example \TriExe{epetra/ex13.cpp} implements a simple distributed
  finite-element solver.  The code solves a 2D Laplace problem with
  unstructured triangular grids. In this example, the information about
  the grid are hardwired.  The interested user can easily modify those
  lines in order to read the grid information from a file.
\item Example \TriExe{epetra/ex15.cpp} explains how to export an
  Epetra\_CrsMatrix to file in a MATLAB format.  The output of this
  example will be as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
[msala:epetra]> mpirun -np 2 ./ex15
A = spalloc(5,5,13);
% On proc 0: 3 rows and 8 nonzeros
A(1,1) = 2;
A(1,2) = -1;
A(2,1) = -1;
A(2,2) = 2;
A(2,3) = -1;
A(3,2) = -1;
A(3,3) = 2;
A(3,4) = -1;
% On proc 1: 2 rows and 5 nonzeros
A(4,4) = 2;
A(4,5) = -1;
A(4,3) = -1;
A(5,4) = -1;
A(5,5) = 2;
\end{verbatim}
  A companion to this
  example is \newline \TriExe{epetra/ex16.cpp}, which exports an Epetra\_Vector to
  MATLAB format.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Creating Block Matrices}
\label{sec:sparse_vbr}

In this section we will show how to work with block matrices (where each
block has a small dimension with respect to the dimension of the entire
matrix)\footnote{Trilinos offers capabilities to deal with matrices
  composed by few large blocks, like for instance matrices arising from
  the discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations,
  through the Meros package (not covered in this tutorial).}. This
format has been designed for PDE problems with more than one unknown per
grid node.  The resulting matrix has a sparse block structure, and the
size of each dense block equals the number of PDE equations defined on
that block.  This format is quite general, and can handle matrices with
variable block size, as it is done is the following example.

First, we create a map, containing the distribution of the blocks:
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_Map Map(NumGlobalElements,0,Comm);
\end{verbatim}
Here, a linear decomposition is used for the sake of simplicity, but any
map can be used as well.
Now, we obtain some information about the map:
\begin{verbatim}
// local number of elements
int NumMyElements = Map.NumMyElements();
// global numbering of local elements
int * MyGlobalElements = new int [NumMyElements];
Map.MyGlobalElements( MyGlobalElements );
\end{verbatim}
A block matrix can have blocks of different size.  Here, we suppose that
the dimension of diagonal block row $i$ is $i+1$.  The integer vector
\verb!ElementSizeList! will contain the block size of local element
\verb!i!.
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_IntSerialDenseVector ElementSizeList(NumMyElements);
 for( int i=0 ; i<NumMyElements ; ++i ) 
   ElementSizeList[i] = 1+MyGlobalElements[i];
\end{verbatim}
Here \verb!ElementSizeList! is declared as Epetra\_IntSerialDenseVector,
but an int array is fine as well.

Now we can create a map for the block distribution:
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_BlockMap BlockMap(NumGlobalElements,NumMyElements,
                         MyGlobalElements, 
                         ElementSizeList.Values(),0,Comm);
\end{verbatim}
and finally we can create the VBR matrix based on \verb!BlockMap!. In
this case, nonzero elements are located in the diagonal and the
sub-diagonal above the diagonal.
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_VbrMatrix A(Copy, BlockMap, 2);

int Indices[2];
double Values[MaxBlockSize];

for( int i=0 ; i<NumMyElements ; ++i ) {
  int GlobalNode = MyGlobalElements[i];
  Indices[0] = GlobalNode;
  int NumEntries = 1;
  if( GlobalNode != NumGlobalElements-1 ) {
    Indices[1] = GlobalNode+1;
    NumEntries++;
  }
  A.BeginInsertGlobalValues(GlobalNode, NumEntries, Indices);
  // insert diagonal
  int BlockRows = ElementSizeList[i];
  for( int k=0 ; k<BlockRows * BlockRows ; ++k )
    Values[k] = 1.0*i;
  B.SubmitBlockEntry(Values,BlockRows,BlockRows,BlockRows);

  // insert off diagonal if any
  if( GlobalNode != NumGlobalElements-1 ) {
    int BlockCols = ElementSizeList[i+1];
    for( int k=0 ; k<BlockRows * BlockCols ; ++k )
      Values[k] = 1.0*i;
    B.SubmitBlockEntry(Values,BlockRows,BlockRows,BlockCols);
  }
  B.EndSubmitEntries();
}
\end{verbatim}
Note that, with VBR matrices, we have to insert one block at time.  This
required two more instructions, one to start this process
(\verb!BeginInsertGlobalValues!), and another one to commit the end of
submissions (\verb!EndSubmitEntries!).

\subsection{Insert non-local Elements Using FE Matrices}
\label{sec:fematrix}

The most important additional feature provided by the
Epetra\_FECrsMatrix with respect to Epetra\_CrsMatrix, is the capability
of setting non-local matrix elements. We will illustrate this using the
following example, reported in \TriExe{epetra/ex23.cpp}. In the example,
we will set all the entries of a distributed matrix from process 0. For
the sake of simplicity, this matrix is diagonal, but more complex cases
can be handled as well.

First, we define the Epetra\_FECrsMatrix in Copy mode as
\begin{verbatim}
Epetra_FECrsMatrix A(Copy,Map,1);
\end{verbatim}
Now, we will set all the diagonal entries from process 0:
\begin{verbatim}
if( Comm.MyPID() == 0 ) {
  for( int i=0 ; i<NumGlobalElements ; ++i ) {
    int indices[2];
    indices[0] = i; indices[1] = i;
    double value = 1.0*i;
    A.SumIntoGlobalValues(1,indices,&value);
  }
}
\end{verbatim}
The Function \verb!SumIntoGlobalValues! adds the coefficients specified
in \verb!indices! (as pair row-column) to the matrix, adding them to any
coefficient that may exist at the specified location. In a finite
element code, the user will probably insert more than one coefficient
at time (typically, all the matrix entries corresponding to an elemental
matrix).

At this point, we need to exchange data, to that each matrix element not
owned by process 0 could be send to the owner, as specified by
\verb!Map!. This is accomplished by calling, on all processes,
\begin{verbatim}
A.GlobalAssemble();
\end{verbatim}
A simple 
\begin{verbatim}
cout << A;
\end{verbatim}
can be used to verify the data exchange.
