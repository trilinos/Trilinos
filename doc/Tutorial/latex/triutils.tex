\section{Generating Linear Systems with Triutils}
\label{chap:triutils}

This Chapter presents two functionalities of Triutils, that will be
extensively used in the examples of the later chapters: 
\begin{itemize}
\item the Triutils command line parser (in
  Section~\ref{sec:triutils:CLP});
\item the Triutils matrix generator (in \ref{sec:triutils:gallery}).
\end{itemize}
The reader not interested in the examples may decide to skip this chapter.

\subsection{Trilinos\_Util\_CommandLineParser}
\label{sec:triutils:CLP}

\verb!Trilinos_Util_CommandLineParser! is a class to parse the command
line.  With this class, it is easy to handle
input line arguments and shell variables. For instance, the user can
write
\begin{verbatim}
[msala:triutils]> ./ex2.exe -nx 10 -tol 1e-6 -solver=cg
\end{verbatim}
and then easily retrieve the value of {\tt nx}, {\tt tol}, and {\tt solver}.
 
A simple code using this class is as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{

  Trilinos_Util_CommandLineParser CLP(argc,argv);
  int nx = CLP.Get("-nx", 123);
  int ny = CLP.Get("-ny", 145);
  double tol = CLP.Get("-tol", 1e-12);
  string solver = CLP.Get("-solver","gmres");

  cout << "nx = " << nx << endl;
  cout << "ny = " << ny << " (default value)" << endl;
  cout << "tol = " << tol << endl;
  cout << "solver = " << solver << endl;

  return 0;
}
\end{verbatim}

Each line   option can have a value or not. For options with a value,
the user can specify this values as follows. Let \verb!-tolerance! be the
name of the option and \verb!1e-12! its value. Both choices are valid:
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb!-tolerance 1e-12! (with one or more spaces)
\item \verb!-tolerance=1e-12! (with \verb!=! sign and no spaces)
\end{itemize}

Option names must begin with one or more dashes (`\verb!-!'). Each option
cannot have more than one value.

To use this class, the user has to build the database using the
\verb!argc,argv! input arguments. Then, to retrieve the option value,
the user has the overloaded function \verb!Get!.
 
If option name is not found in the database, the default value is
returned. If needed, the user can also specify a default value to return
when the option name is not found in the database. Method
\verb!HaveOption! can be used to query the database for an option.

File \TriExe{triutils/ex2.cpp} gives an example of the usage of this class.

\subsection{Trilinos\_Util\_CrsMatrixGallery}
\label{sec:triutils:gallery}

\verb!Trilinos_Util_CrsMatrixGallery! is a class to Epetra\_CrsMatrix
and Epetra\_LinearProblem. It is meant to provide functionalities
similar to the MATLAB's \verb!gallery! function\footnote{Many of the
  matrices that can be created using Trilinos\_Util\_CrsMatrixGallery
  are equivalent or simiilar to those provided by the MATLAB\copyright
  function {\tt gallery}. In these cases, the reader is referred to the
  MATLAB documentation for more details about the matrices'
  properties.}.

A typical constructor requires the problem type and an Epetra\_Comm, and
it is followed by a set of instructions to specify the problem. For
instance, we may have:
\begin{verbatim}
Trilinos_Util_CrsMatrixGallery Gallery("laplace_2d", Comm);
Gallery.set("problem_size",100);
Gallery.set("map_type","linear");
Gallery.set("solution_type","random");
\end{verbatim}
which creates a matrix corresponding to the discretization of a 2D
Laplacian on a Cartesian grid with 100 points. The nodes are decomposed
linearly, and the exact solution is a random vector.

Alternatively, it is possible to read a matrix stored in Harwell/Boeing
format as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
Trilinos_Util_CrsMatrixGallery Gallery("hb", Comm);
Gallery.set("matrix_name","bcsstk14.rsa");
Gallery.set("map_type","greedy");
\end{verbatim}
This snipper will read matrix (and, if available, solution and
right-hand side) from the file \verb!bcsstk14.rsa!, and will partition
the matrix across the processes using a gredy algorithm.

A list of currently avaialble problems is reported below. By notation,
\verb!IntValue! refers to a generic positive integer, {\tt
  a,b,c,d,e,f,g} to double-precision values or the Epetra\_Vector.
defined on the map \verb!Gallery.GetMap()!. In the latter case, vector
elements {\tt i} will be use to define the specified coefficient for row
{\tt i}.  Note that some matrices are dense, but still stored as
Epetra\_CrsMatrix. The generic $(i,j)$ element of a given matrix is
$A_{i,j}$ (for simplicity, we suppose that indices start from
1\footnote{It is understood that, in the actual implementation, indices
  start from 0.}). $n$ represents the matrix size.

\vskip .1 in

\choicebox{\tt eye}{Creates an identity matrix. The size of the
  problem is set using {\tt Set("problem size", IntValue)}, or,
  alternatively, by {\tt Set("nx", IntValue)}.}

        diag(1:m) &     a * eye(n/2) \\
\end{tabular}
      \right].

\medskip

Some choices are available to define the exact solution, using {\tt

\choicebox{\tt random}{Assign each node to a random process}

\choicebox{\tt greedy}{(only for HB matrices) implements a greedy

\bigskip

Once all the required parameters have been specified, the user can get a
pointer to the constructed Epetra\_CrsMatrix, to the exact and starting
solution, and to the right-hand side (all Epetra\_Vector's) by using
\begin{verbatim}
A = G.GetMatrix();
ExactSolution = G.GetExactSolution();
RHS = G.GetRHS();
StartingSolution = G.GetStartingSolution();
\end{verbatim}
and a pointer to the Epetra\_LinearProblem as
\begin{verbatim}  
Epetra_LinearProblem Problem(A,StartingSolution,RHS);
\end{verbatim}
At this point, one can for instance solve the linear problem as
\begin{verbatim}  
AztecOO Solver(Problem);
Solver.SetAztecOption( AZ_precond, AZ_dom_decomp );  
Solver.Iterate(1000,1E-9);
\end{verbatim}
Using Trilinos\_Util\_MatrixGallery, one can easily compute the true
residual and the difference between computed and exact solution, as
\begin{verbatim} 
double residual;
G.ComputeResidual(residual);
  
G.ComputeDiffBetweenStartingAndExactSolutions(residual);
\end{verbatim}

The matrix can be written on a file in MATLAB format, using
\begin{verbatim}
string FileName = "matrix.m";
bool UseSparse = false;
Gallert.WriteMatrix(FileName,UseSparse);
\end{verbatim}
If \verb!UseSparse! is true, the matrix is created in sparse format
(using the MATLAB command \verb!spalloc!).

\medskip

%An Epetra\_VrbMatrix pointer is returned by calling
%\verb!GetVbrMatrix()!.  This matrix is formed starting from the
%Epetra\_CsrMatrix, and it is formally equivalent to the CrsMatrix
%returned by \verb!GetMatrix()!, the difference being that each node of
%the CrsMatrix is replicated num\_PDE\_eqns times (this value is passed in
%input, or set via Set("num pde eqns",IntValue)). 
%A pointer to the linear problem defined by the Vbr matrix is returned by
%method \verb!GetVbrLinearProblem()!.

\medskip

Trilinos\_Util\_CrsMatrixGallery can be used in conjuction with
Trilinos\_Util\_CommandLineParser as in the following code:
\begin{verbatim}
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) 
{
 #ifdef HAVE_MPI
  MPI_Init(&argc,&argv);
  Epetra_MpiComm Comm(MPI_COMM_WORLD);
#else
  Epetra_SerialComm Comm;
#endif

  Epetra_Time Time(Comm);

  Trilinos_Util_CommandLineParser CLP(argc,argv);
  Trilinos_Util_CrsMatrixGallery Gallery("", Comm);

  Gallery.Set(CLP);

  // get matrix
  Epetra_CrsMatrix * Matrix = Gallery.GetMatrix();
  Epetra_Vector * LHS = Gallery.GetLHS();
  Epetra_Vector * StartingSolution = Gallery.GetStartingSolution();
  Epetra_Vector * ExactSolution = Gallery.GetExactSolution();
  Epetra_LinearProblem * Problem =  Gallery.GetLinearProblem();

  // various computatons...

  // check that computed solution (in StartingSolution) 
  // is close enough the ExactSolution

  double residual, diff;

  Gallery.ComputeResidual(residual);
  Gallery.ComputeDiffBetweenStartingAndExactSolutions(diff);
  
  if( Comm.MyPID()==0 ) 
    cout << "||b-Ax||_2 = " << residual << endl;

  if( Comm.MyPID()==0 ) 
    cout << "||x_exact - x||_2 = " << diff << endl;

#ifdef HAVE_MPI
  MPI_Finalize() ;
#endif

  return 0 ;

}
\end{verbatim}
This program can be executed with the following command line:
\begin{verbatim}
[msala:triutils]> mpirun -np 4 ex1.exe -problem_type=laplace_2d \
                  -problem_size=10000
\end{verbatim}

\begin{remark}
  Most of the examples reported in the following chapters use both
  Trilinos\_Util\_CommandLineParser and Trilinos\_Util\_CrsMatrixGallery
  to define the distributed matrix. The user is encouraged to test a
  given method using matrices with different numerical properties.
\end{remark}
