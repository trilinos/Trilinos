This module is a general interface to geometric data and operations.
The first sub-module, create_ON, creates OpenNURBS representations of
2D point sets using fitting schemes.  The resulting 3dm file can be
written and then used with a mesh to project nodes, or perform other
geometric operations.  It depends on the OpenNURBS library.
