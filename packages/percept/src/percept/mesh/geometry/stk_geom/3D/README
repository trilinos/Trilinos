Code to fit a piecewise G1 spline to a heterogeneous surface mesh of
tri and quad faces.  Uses Gregory patches.  See doc directory for
background and technical papers.

Algorithm is based on the paper
FarinHansford-Agnostic-tri-quad-Gregory_paper.pdf. The authors were
generous to contribute the Mathematica code for that paper, found here
in general_gregory_dch.{nb,m}.

Note: the files with .mcpp extension are Mathematica Splice files - do
not edit the corresponding .cpp files since they are generated from
the notebook: tri-greg-7-1.nb (evaluate all cells).
