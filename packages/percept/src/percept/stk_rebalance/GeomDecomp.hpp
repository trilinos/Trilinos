/** \file GeomDecomp.hpp
 *
 * \brief Geometric support for partitioning of mesh entities.
 *
 * This file contains a single class GeomDecomp derived from
 * the Partition class.  GeomDecomp adds geometric computations
 * to be used in determining an optimal distribution of mesh
 * entities.  GeomDecomp defines some virtual functions that
 * are to be specialized by the class that actually determines
 * the optimal distribution.
 *
 * Presently, only the support class for Zoltan,
 * specializes the GeomDecomp class.  If another optimal
 * distribution method is to be implemented, it should
 * be based on the GeomDecomp class.  This will enable application
 * codes to include just the GeomDecomp base class without
 * having specialized knowledge of the derived classes.

/** \class GeomDecomp 
 *
 * \brief Class for determining the optimal partitioning of mesh entities.
 *
 * Derived from the \a Partition class.
 *
 * The \a GeomDecomp class has no data associated with it, only
 * member functions.  All data is inherited from the \a Partition
 * class.
 *
 * \a GeomDecomp has two functions.  It adds functions to
 * compute geometry information for mesh entities, such as the
 * center point for a mesh entity.  And it defines virtual
 * functions to be specialized by other classes that interface
 * to partitioning packages such as \a Zoltan.
