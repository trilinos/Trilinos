\section sacado_intro Introduction 
Sacado is a set of automatic differentiation tools for C++ applications.  It
provides templated classes for forward, reverse and Taylor mode automatic 
differentiation.

\section sacado_startup Overview of sacado

Sacado contains several basic AD classes:

<ul> 
<li> Forward mode AD with the number of derivative components chosen at run-time:  Sacado::Fad::DFad (most flexible)
<li>  Forward mode AD with the number of derivative components chosen at compile-time:  Sacado::Fad::SFad (most efficient)
<li>  Forward mode AD with the maximum number of derivative components chosen at compile-time but actual number used chosen at run-time:  Sacado::Fad::SLFad (sits between Sacado::Fad::DFad and Sacado::Fad::SFad in flexibility and efficiency)
<li> Reverse mode:  Sacado::Rad::ADvar
<li> High-order univariate Taylor polynomials:  Sacado::Taylor::DTaylor
</ul>

Experimental AD classes:

<ul>
<li> Forward mode AD using caching expression templates:  Sacado::CacheFad::DFad.  Preliminary testing indicates this approach is more efficient for deep expressions with large number of derivative components, but is less efficient and Sacado::Fad::DFad otherwise.
</ul>

\section sacado_browser Browse all of sacado as a single doxygen collection

You can browse all of Sacado as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about Sacado software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of sacado</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.
