# Sacado Package

Sacado is a software package for automatic differentiation (AD) of C++ code
using operator overloading.  It provides classes for forward, reverse,
and Taylor polynomial mode automatic differentiation.  The forward mode
AD classes were developed from the expression template based classes in 
the Fad package by Nicolas Di Cesare (Nicolas.Dicesare@ann.jussieu.fr).  The
Fad package is available at http://www.ann.jussieu.fr/~dicesare.  A portion
of the original Fad package is also included here in the Fad directory.
