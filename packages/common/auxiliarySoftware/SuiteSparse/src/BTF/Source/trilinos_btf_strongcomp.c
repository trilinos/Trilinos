/* Perform a depth-first-search of a graph, stored in an adjacency-list form.
 * The row indices of column j (equivalently, the out-adjacency list of node j)
 * are stored in Ai [Ap[j] ... Ap[j+1]-1].  Self-edge (diagonal entries) are
 * ignored.  Ap[0] must be zero, and thus nz = Ap[n] is the number of entries
 * in the matrix (or edges in the graph).  The row indices in each column need
 * not be in any particular order.  If an input column permutation is given,
 * node j (in the permuted matrix A*Q) is located in
 * Ai [Ap[Q[j]] ... Ap[Q[j]+1]-1].  This Q can be the same as the Match array
 * output from the maxtrans routine, for a square matrix that is structurally
 * full rank.
 *
 * The algorithm is from the paper by Robert E. Tarjan, "Depth-first search and
 * linear graph algorithms," SIAM Journal on Computing, vol. 1, no. 2,
 * pp. 146-160, 1972.  The time taken by strongcomp is O(nnz(A)).
 *
 * See also MC13A/B in the Harwell subroutine library (Iain S. Duff and John
 * K. Reid, "Algorithm 529: permutations to block triangular form," ACM Trans.
 * on Mathematical Software, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 189-192, 1978, and "An
 * implementation of Tarjan's algorithm for the block triangular form of a
 * matrix," same journal, pp. 137-147.  This code is implements the same
 * algorithm as MC13A/B, except that the data structures are very different.
 * Also, unlike MC13A/B, the output permutation preserves the natural ordering
 * within each block.
