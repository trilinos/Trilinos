The borders have to be local or distributed depending on the separator.

Avoid the matrix multiply every time to do a transpose. Store the transposed
matrix.

Fix the narrow separator for the case when the matrix already has a separator.

Can we make Amesos_Schur cheaper ?

Switch inner solve to Belos.

Fix KLU's triangular solve.

Change probing operator to handle local and distributed cases. Avoid doing
this in the factor.

Refactor the three copies of the computeApproxSchur for wide, narrow and
guided probing into something manageable.

Start using the debug manager correctly.
