     * @class GeometricOverlappingOperator
     *
     * The GeometricOverlappingOperator is derived from the OverlappingOperator. 
     * It is used to build a geometric (optimized) Schwarz preconditioner.  
     *
     * In the construction of the preconditioner, the algebraic decomposition of the matrix 
     * itself always results in Dirichlet boundary conditions. The local system matrix must 
     * be assembled separately to apply different boundary conditions in the preconditioner, 
     * e.g., Robin, perfectly matched layer, or other absorbing boundary conditions.  This 
     * is precisely what we do here: we employ the locally assembled system matrix to allow 
     * for different interface conditions.
     *
     * This backbone class is designed for use in the OneLevelOptimizedPreconditioner 
     * or TwoLevelOptimizedPreconditioner Preconditioner class. It handles the creation 
     * of overlapping subproblems (based on some global problem description) and provides 
     * tools to create local subproblems in other finite element software (e.g., deal.II).
     *
     * @tparam SC The scalar type. (default is double)
     * @tparam LO The local ordinal type. (default is int)
     * @tparam GO The global ordinal type. (default is DefaultGlobalOrdinal)
     * @tparam NO The node type. (default is Tpetra::KokkosClassic::DefaultNode::DefaultNodeType)
