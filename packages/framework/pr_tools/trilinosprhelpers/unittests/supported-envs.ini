# supported-envs.ini
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is a configuration file for the `LoadEnv` tool, used to specify what
# environments are available on what systems.  The file is broken up into
# sections, where each section has the following syntax:
#
#   [system-name]
#   env-name-1:
#       alias-1
#       alias-2
#       # etc.
#   env-name-2:
#       alias-3
#       alias-4
#   env-name-3 # without any aliases
#   # etc.
#
# All environment names and aliases within a section must be unique.  The
# recommended convention for environment names is to use
# `<compiler>-<compiler-version>-<mpi>-<mpi-version>-<node-type>`, where
# `<node-type>` is either `serial` or `openmp` and is not applicable to CUDA
# environments.
#
# Adding aliases to environment names is optional, but is a convenience to the
# user so they can `source load-env.sh cuda` instead of
# `source load-env.sh cuda-10.1.243-gnu-7.3.1-spmpi-rolling` on the command
# line on `ats2`, for instance.

#
# Modifying an Existing Environment
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# It is not recommended that you change the versions of the compiler or MPI
# implementation for an existing environment.  Instead see below to add a new
# environment.
#
# If you wish to modify the aliases for the environments on a system---for
# instance, if a new environment was stood up and it's been sufficiently
# vetted---the process to do so is:
#
#   1. Find the system whose environments you would like to update.
#   2. Adjust the aliases as needed.
#   3. Ensure all the environment names and aliases for the system are unique.
#
# Example:
#
#   Before:
#
#     [tlcc2]
#     intel-18.0.0-openmpi-1.10.5-openmp:
#         intel-18
#         intel
#         default-env
#     intel-19.0.5-openmpi-4.0.5-openmp:
#         intel-19
#
#   After:
#
#     [tlcc2]
#     intel-18.0.0-openmpi-1.10.5-openmp:
#         intel-18    # remove aliases from the old environment
#     intel-19.0.5-openmpi-4.0.5-openmp:
#         intel-19
#         intel       # add them to the new one
#         default-env # effectively promoting from Intel 18 to 19
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Adding a New Environment to an Existing System
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# To stand up a new environment on a currently supported system, the process
# is:
#
#   1. Find the system to which you would like to add the new environment.
#   2. Determine a new environment name (see above for the naming convention).
#   3. Add the new environment name as a new line under the `[system-name]`
#      section heading.  The environment names are organized alphabetically
#      within a section.
#   4. If you wish to add any aliases to the new environment name, add a colon
#      after the environment name, and then add the aliases on subsequent
#      lines, making sure to indent them.  Note that you may wish to update
#      aliases to the existing environments as well.
#   5. Ensure all the environment names and aliases for the system are unique.
#   6. Head to `environment-specs.ini` to add the specification for the new
#      environment there.
#
# Example:
#
#   Before:
#
#     [tlcc2]
#     intel-18.0.0-openmpi-1.10.5-openmp:
#         intel
#         default-env
#
#   After:
#
#     [tlcc2]
#     intel-18.0.0-openmpi-1.10.5-openmp:
#         intel-18                        # new alias to existing environment
#         intel
#         default-env
#     intel-19.0.5-openmpi-4.0.5-openmp:  # new environment
#         intel-19                        # new alias to new environment
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Removing an Environment
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# When a particular environment is no longer needed on a system---for instance,
# if a new environment was stood up to replace it and it's been sufficiently
# vetted---the process to remove an environment is:
#
#   1. Find the system you're concerned with in the file.
#   2. Find the environment you wish to remove.
#   3. Remove the lines with the environment name and any aliases to it, if
#      they exist.
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Adding a New Environment for a New System
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# When standing up a completely new system, the procedure is:
#
#   1. Add the new system to `supported-systems.ini`.
#   2. Add a new `[system-name]` section heading to this file.  The systems are
#      organized alphabetically within the file.
#   3. Add one or more environment names and any applicable aliases underneath
#      that section heading.  See above for how to add a new environment.
#   4. Head to `environment-specs.ini` to add the specifications for the new
#      environments there.
