/*! @defgroup kokkos_node_api Kokkos Node API

  \section kokkos_node_api_intro Introduction to the Node API

  The %Kokkos Node API is intended to provide a generic interface for programming shared-memory parallel nodes. Generic programming 
  of an arbitrary shared-memory node is difficult for a number of reasons, particularly: 
  - the fact that the shared-memory node may employ a memory pool distinct from that of the host thread (for example, on some GPU-based platforms); and
  - the need to program to a particular node-specific API for parallel execution of user kernels.

  Along these lines, the %Kokkos Node API is broken into two orthogonal components:
  - The Node API Memory Model<br>
    This describes the methods necessary for allocating and using memory on a shared-memory node, including
    - allocation and deallocation of parallel memory segments
    - copying data to/from (potentially distinct) parallel memory segments
    - efficiently extracting read-only and modifiable views to parallel memory segments
    - preparing parallel memory for execution
  - The Node API Compute Model<br>
    This descries the interface for executing parallel kernels on a shared-memory node.

  
  \section kokkos_node_api_memory_model Node API Memory Model

   The following describes the methods on a node object required to support the node API memory model, for some sample node \c SomeNode:
   \code
   class SomeNode {
   public:
     // isHostNode == true indicates that memory allocated by the node may be safely accessed on the host thread
     static const bool isHostNode = ...

     // Allocate a segment of memory for use in parallel kernels (a <i><b>parallel compute buffer</b></i>)
     template <class T>
     ArrayRCP<T> allocBuffer(size_t size)

     // Copy data to the host from a parallel compute buffer.
     template <class T>
     void copyFromBuffer(size_t size, const ArrayRCP<const T> &buffSrc, const ArrayView<T> &hostDest)

     // Copy data from the host to a parallel compute buffer.
     template <class T>
     void copyToBuffer(size_t size, const ArrayView<const T> &hostSrc, const ArrayRCP<T> &buffDest)

     // Copy data from one parallel compute buffer to another.
     template <class T>
     void copyBuffers(size_t size, const ArrayRCP<const T> &buffSrc, const ArrayRCP<T> &buffDest)

     // Return a read-only view of a parallel compute buffer for use on the host thread.
     template <class T>
     ArrayRCP<const T> viewBuffer(size_t size, ArrayRCP<const T> buff)

     // Return a modifiable view of a parallel compute compute for use on the host thread.
     template <class T>
     ArrayRCP<T> viewBufferNonConst(ReadWriteOption rw, size_t size, const ArrayRCP<T> &buff)

     // Prepare a set of parallel compute buffers for use in a parallel kernel.
     void readyBuffers(ArrayView<ArrayRCP<const char> > buffers, ArrayView<ArrayRCP<char> > ncBuffers)
   };
   \endcode

   The distinction made between views and copies is significant. On a GPU-based
   parallel platform, parallel compute buffers may not be accessible from the
   host thread. However, on a CPU-based platform, they are. It is preferably to
   devise an access model which enables generic code to run on the GPU
   platform, without incurring unnecessary memory costs on the CPU platform. By
   requiring the user to explicitly distinguish between a copy to/from parallel
   memory and some artibtrary host access of the parallel memory, we allow
   optimal efficiency in either case. Furthermore, by providing the
   compile-time <tt>Node::isHostNode</tt> flag for each \c Node class, we allow
   the users to forgoe generic code in the cases where greater efficiency can
   be achieved otherwise.
  
   The \c readyBuffers method is technically required to be called for a set of
   buffers before their use in a parallel kernel. However, the current node
   implementations in %Kokkos only perform debugging in this method, and
   therefore neglecting to call this method (especially in a non-debug mode)
   does not effect the correctness of the code. Future node implementations,
   however, may require that this method is called (for example, a device-based
   node which swaps out parallel buffers due to limited memory.) The class
   ReadyBufferHelper assists in calling this method.

   For example, consider the sample code below, templated on the generic node \c SomeNode:
   \code
   template <class SomeNode>
   void initializeNodeMemory(RCP<SomeNode> node)
   {
     // alloc a buffer of ten integers "on the node"
     ArrayRCP<int> buffA  = node->allocBuffer<int>( 10 );

     // get a view to the allocated buffer, that we can access on the host
     // * on a CPU node, this will result in viewA == buffA
     // * on a GPU node, this is not the case; however, the WriteOnly flag will 
     //   not initiate a copy to the host; the initial contents of viewA are undefined.
     ArrayRCP<int> viewA = node->viewBufferNonConst<int>( Kokkos::WriteOnly, 10, buffA );
     for (int i=0; i < 10; ++i) {
       viewA[i] = someFunction(i); // initialize the view on the host
     }
     // free the view. the changes to the view are realized in the buffer only after all references 
     // to the view have been freed and its deallocator has been called.
     // the contents of buffA are undefined while the view is active.
     viewA = Teuchos::null; 
     // at this point, the entries of buffA are initialized as follows:
     //   buffA[i] = someFunction(i)
     
     // allocate another buffer
     ArrayRCP<int> buffB = node->allocBuffer<int>( 3 );
     // copy the last three entries of buffA into buffB
     // after this is finished, buffB[i] = buffA[7+i], for i=0:2
     node->copyBuffers<int>( 3, buffA+7, buffB );

     // get a view of buffB, verify that its entries were properly set
     // this view is const and cannot change buffB. the availability of buffB
     // for computation is not affected by the existence of viewB.
     // * on a GPU-based node, this requires a copy of these entries to the host
     // * on a CPU-based node, there is no copy, and viewB == buffB == buffA+7 (except that the first of these is const)
     ArrayRCP<const int> viewB = node->viewBuffer<int>( 3, buffB );
     for (int i=0; i<3; ++i) {
       assert( viewB[i] == someFunction(i+7) );
     }
     // free the view. there were no changes, so even for a device platform with distinct
     // memory, there will be no copy back to device memory.
     viewB = Teuchos::null;
   }
   \endcode
   
   For a host-based compute node (i.e., one where <tt>SomeNode::isHostNode == true</tt>), the above code will:
   -# allocate ten integers (buffA) and initialize them
   -# allocate three integers (buffB)
   -# copy the last three of buffA to buffB
   -# verify the contents of buffB

   However, on a device-based compute node with distinct memory (like many GPU platforms), the above code will:
   -# allocated ten integers (buffA) on the device
   -# allocated ten integers (viewA) on the host and initialize them
   -# copy these from the host (viewA) to the device (buffA) and free the host allocation (viewA)
   -# allocate three integers on the device (buffB)
   -# copy three integers from the device to the device (buffA to buffB)
   -# allocate three integers on the host (viewB) 
   -# copy three integers from the device (buffB) to the host (viewB)
   -# verify the contents of viewB
   -# release the host allocation (viewB)

   The distinction between these is entirely due to the specific implementation of the methods of the specific node class.

  \section kokkos_node_api_compute_model Node API Compute Model

  The Node API compute model specifies the parallel primitives available for a
  generic %Kokkos node, as well as the interface by which user kernels are
  submitted for execution. Currently, the compute model specifies two parallel primitive:
  - parallel_for: execute a parallel for loop with a user-specified loop body
  - parallel_reduce: execute a parallel reduction of user-specified elements, using a user-specified reduction operation

  The Node API specifies one additional routine. Each node is required to provide a sync() method, which blocks until any outstanding
  memory or computational operations are complete. This is only significant for nodes that support asynchronous computation or memory transfer (e.g., CUDA-based nodes). For
  other nodes, this will typically be a no-op.

  Below is the interface for these methods, for some sample node \c SomeNode:
  \code 
  class SomeNode {
  public:
    template <class ForLoopBody>
    void 
    parallel_for(int begin, int end, ForLoopBody body);

    template <class ReductionKernel>
    typename ReductionKernel::ReductionType 
    parallel_reduce(int begin, int end, ReductionKernel rd);
  };
  \endcode

  \subsection kokkos_node_api_parallel_for Parallel For

  The \c ForLoopBody object is required to provide the following:
  \code
  class ForLoopBody {
  public:
    KERNEL_PREFIX void execute(int iter);
  };
  \endcode
  This method executes iteration number \c iter of the for loop. Optionally
  (and typically), the data members of the class will contain the data
  necessary to execute the for loop.

  The KERNEL_PREFIX macro is required to be inserted before all methods that
  are called by a parallel kernel. This is typically an empty macro, but it may
  contain helpful or necessary function specifiers on some platforms (for example, on CUDA platforms, 
  it resolves to "__global__ __device__").

  This class is combine with the \c parallel_for method as follows:
  \code
  ForLoopBody body(...);
  SomeNode<ForLoopBody>( beg, end, body );
  \endcode
  The semantics of this call imply that:
  - <tt>body::execute(iter)</tt> will be called exactly \f$(end - beg)\f$ times, with values of \f$iter \in [beg,end)\f$.
  - The calls to \c execute may occur in parallel and in any order.

  \subsection kokkos_node_api_parallel_reduce Parallel Reduce

  The \c ReductionKernel object is a little larger, requiring to provide the
  following, in addtion to any user-specified data member necessary to
  implement the reduction:
  \code
  class ReductionKernel {
  public:
    typedef ... ReductionType;
    KERNEL_PREFIX ReductionType identity() const;
    KERNEL_PREFIX ReductionType generate(int element);
    KERNEL_PREFIX ReductionType reduce(ReductionType a, ReductionType b) const;
  };
  \endcode

  This class is combined with the \c parallel_reduce method as follows:
  \code
  ReductionKernel kern(...);
  ReductionKernel::ReductionType result = SomeNode<ReductionKernel>( beg, end, kern );
  \endcode
  The semantics of this call imply that:
  - <tt>kern::generate(elem)</tt> is called exactly \f$(end - beg)\f$ times, with the values of \f$elem \in [beg,end)\f$. This permits the method to effect predicatble side-effects.
  - \c identity and \c reduce are required to satisfy <tt>reduce( a, identity() ) == reduce( identity(), a ) == a</tt>, for any <tt>ReductionType a</tt>
  - The product \c result is the reduction of the entries generated by \c generate, up to any finite-precision effects inherent in \c reduce.

/*! @defgroup kokkos_crs_ops Kokkos Compresssed-Row Sparse API

  In order to facilitate the substitution of sparse matrix kernels in classes
  such as Tpetra::CrsMatrix, %Kokkos separates the data structure interface for
  a compressed-sparse-row (CRS) matrix from the kernel for implemeneting sparse
  matrix-vector multiplication and solves. However, the appropriate
  implementation of these kernels for a particular platform may dictate some of
  the design of the storage classes. Furthermore, for reasons of efficiency and
  generic programming reach, these are implemented statically. The
  approach that Tpetra employs is to template the distributed Tpetra::CrsMatrix
  objects on the type of the local matrix kernels.  This decision permeates down
  to the level of the CRS objects in the %Kokkos linear algebra library.

  The primary object in this discussion is the class providing the sparse
  matrix kernels. The simplest way to modify the operation of the Tpetra
  objects is to first create a new sparse kernels class and then to template
  the Tpetra::CrsMatrix and Tpetra::CrsGraph objects on this kernel class.

  \note It may seem strange that the Kokkos and Tpetra CRS graph objects are
  templated on the sparse kernels class, as the graph object does not provide
  multiplication and solve methods. However, because the sparse kernels may
  dictate the storage, they must have some input into the design of the sparse
  graph class, in addition to their obvious significance to the matrix class.

  The following simplified code demonstrates the relationship between these objects and their typical usage:
  \code
    typedef typename SparseKernels::graph<        int,Node>::graph_type  Graph;
    typedef typename SparseKernels::matrix<double,int,Node>::matrix_type Matrix;
    Graph G(numRows,node);
    Matri M(G);
    SparseKernels ops;
    ops.setGraphAndMatrix( G, M );
    ops.multiply( x, y );
    ops.solve( b, x );
  \endcode
  In this example, we instantiate a graph and a matrix. Note, the type of 
  \c CrsGraph and \c CrsMatrix is dictated by the \c SparesKernels class. By parametrizing these classes in this way, we can effect the design of these classes according to 
  the sparse kernels that we are interested in using. After creating the sparse graph and sparse matrix objets,
  we instantiate a \c SparseKernel object and submit the data. Finally, the sparse kernel object can be used to apply the sparse matrix mutiply and solve routines.

  The sparse kernel class must obviously provide the functionality for matrix-vector multiply and matrix-vector solve. Some other functionality is required of this class as well.
  - The sparse kernel object must have an interface by which we can specify the matrix and graph that we are applying.
  - The templated nature of the Tpetra::CrsMatrix class requires that we have the ability to create sparse kernel objects for different scalar fields.

  The code below illustrates these use cases for a sparse kernel provider, as they appear in Tpetra and other Kokkos-enabled linear algebra packages. This example is located at kokkos/LinAlg/examples/DummySparseKernelDriver.cpp.

  \include DummySparseKernelDriver.cpp
  
  This example makes use of the sparse kernel provider stubbed in the class
  KokkosExamples::DummySparseKernel, located in the file
  kokkos/LinAlg/examples/Kokkos_DummySparseKernelClass.hpp. This file, along
  with the unit test
  kokkos/LinAlg/test/CrsMatrix/CrsMatrix_DefaultMultiply.cpp, demonstrate the
  implementation requirements for a sparse kernel provider.
