/** \brief The main class for users to read text using TeuchosParser.
 *
 * This is the most important user-facing class in TeuchosParser.
 * A Reader represents the use of a set of ReaderTables to read (parse)
 * a given stream of text.
 * In most cases, users should create their own class deriving from Teuchos::Reader,
 * and override the Reader::at_shift and Reader::at_reduce methods to implement the mechanics of
 * their custom parser.
 *
 * To use Reader, it must be given an RCP to a set of ReaderTables.
 * In most cases, ReaderTables are constructed automatically from a Language
 * using the make_reader_tables function.
 * Notice that ReaderTables only have to be constructed once, and can be used
 * simultaneously by multiple Readers.
 * A Reader can only operate on one stream of text at a time, and contains all
 * the variable parser state.
 *
 * The Reader also provides some error reporting capability.
 * If the text stream being read is valid as defined by the Language,
 * the Teuchos::ParserFail exception will be thrown with a descriptive string.
 * It is strongly recommended that code using Reader catch this exception and
 * display its what() message to the console.
 *
 * Classes deriving from Teuchos::Reader are also strongly recommended to throw
 * the Teuchos::ParserFail exception class (or a class derived from it) to
 * indicate that the text stream being read is invalid, usually due to constraints
 * that can't be expressed in the Teuchos::Language.
