/// ArrayRCP<double> buf (...); // Buffer for incoming data.
/// RCP<CommRequest<int> > req = ireceive (comm, buf, sourceRank);

/// This object's destructor cancels the request without

/// req = null;
/// \endcode
///
/// \note To implementers: The MPI implementation of this class

/// \class Comm
/// \brief Abstract interface for distributed-memory communication.
/// \tparam Ordinal Type of indices used for communication.
///
/// \section Teuchos_Comm_What What is Comm?
///
/// This class is Teuchos' interface to distributed-memory
/// communication between one or more parallel processes.  It presents
/// an interface very much like that of MPI (the Message Passing
/// Interface).  Teuchos provides two implementations of Comm:
/// - An MPI (Message Passing Interface) implementation, MpiComm
/// - A "serial" implementation, SerialComm, that only has one process
///
/// Comm is an abstract interface.  You cannot create a Comm directly.
/// You have to create one of the subclasses.  The normal way to
/// handle a Comm is to pass it around using RCP (a reference-counted
/// "smart" pointer).  For example:
///
/// \code
/// // Make a Comm.  This one happens to wrap MPI_COMM_WORLD.
/// RCP<const Comm<int> > comm = rcp (new MpiComm (MPI_COMM_WORLD));
/// // Equivalent of MPI_Comm_rank
/// const int myRank = comm->getRank ();
/// // Equivalent of MPI_Comm_size
/// const int numProcs = comm->getSize ();
/// // Equivalent of MPI_Comm_barrier
/// comm->barrier ();
/// \endcode
///
/// Comm's communication methods that actually send or receive data
/// accept that data as an array of \c char.  You should never call
/// these methods directly.  Instead, you should use the nonmember
/// "helper" functions in Teuchos_CommHelpers.hpp.  These methods are
/// templated on the \c Packet type, that is, the type of data you
/// want to send or receive.  See the example below.
///
/// \section Teuchos_Comm_Handle Treat <tt>RCP<const Comm<int> ></tt> like an opaque handle
///
/// You should consider an <tt>RCP<const Comm<int> ></tt> as
/// equivalent to the MPI_Comm opaque handle, except that the RCP also
/// does reference counting to ensure memory safety when using the
/// same communicator in different parts of the code.  That is,
/// copying the RCP does not create a new communicator; the following
/// two codes do about the same thing, except with a different syntax
/// (and reference counting in the second code).
///
/// Raw MPI_Comm handles:
/// \code
/// MPI_Comm comm = ...;
/// // sameComm is THE SAME COMMUNICATOR as comm.
/// MPI_Comm sameComm = comm;
/// \endcode
///
/// Reference-counted pointers to Comm:
/// \code
/// RCP<const Comm<int> > comm = ...;
/// // *sameComm is THE SAME COMMUNICATOR as *comm.
/// RCP<const Comm<int> > sameComm = comm;
/// \endcode
///
/// If you want to make a "new communicator" rather than just "copy
/// the handle," you should call the duplicate() method.  This has the
/// same behavior as MPI_Comm_dup (which see).
///
/// The "reference counting" feature means that the subclass of Comm
/// will take care of freeing the underlying MPI_Comm (and any other
/// data structures it may use) by calling MPI_Comm_free if necessary,
/// once the reference count of the RCP goes to zero.
///
/// \warning Do <i>not</i> pass around subclasses of Comm by value!
///   Comm or its subclasses by themselves do not have handle
///   semantics.  Their copy constructors likely do not behave as you
///   would expect if the classes had handle semantics.
///
/// \section Teuchos_Comm_How How do I make a Comm?
///
/// Comm works whether or not you have build Trilinos with MPI
/// support.  If you want to make a "default" Comm that is the
/// equivalent of MPI_COMM_WORLD, but you don't know if your Trilinos
/// with MPI enabled, you may use GlobalMPISession to call MPI_Init if
/// necessary, and DefaultComm to "get a default communicator."  For
/// example:
/// \code
/// int main (int argc, char* argv[]) {
///   using Teuchos::Comm;
///   using Teuchos::DefaultComm;
///   using Teuchos::RCP;
///
///   // This replaces the call to MPI_Init.  If you didn't
///   // build with MPI, this doesn't call MPI functions.
///   Teuchos::GlobalMPISesssion session (&argc, &argv, NULL);
///   // comm is the equivalent of MPI_COMM_WORLD.
///   RCP<const Comm<int> > comm = DefaultComm<int>::getComm ();
///
///   // ... use comm in your code as you would use MPI_COMM_WORLD ...
///
///   // We don't need to call MPI_Finalize, since the
///   // destructor of GlobalMPISession does that for us.
///   return EXIT_SUCCESS;
/// }
/// \endcode
/// This code works whether or not you built Trilinos with MPI
/// support.  It is not necessary to use GlobalMPISession, but it's
/// useful so you don't have to remember to call MPI_Finalize.  If you
/// don't want to use GlobalMPISession, you can still call
/// <tt>DefaultComm<int>::getComm()</tt>, though you must have called
/// MPI_Init first if you build Trilinos with MPI support.
/// Furthermore, if you know MPI is present, you don't need to use
/// DefaultComm.  You may simply pass MPI_COMM_WORLD directly to
/// MpiComm, like this:
/// \code
/// RCP<const Comm<int> > comm = rcp (new MpiComm (MPI_COMM_WORLD));
/// \endcode
/// You may also pass an arbitrary MPI_Comm directly into MpiComm's
/// constructor, though you are responsible for freeing it after use
/// (via MPI_Comm_free) if necessary.  You may automate the freeing
/// of your MPI_Comm by using OpaqueWrapper (which see).
///
/// \section Teuchos_Comm_Use How do I use Comm?
///
/// As we mentioned above, for communication of data with Comm, you
/// you should use the nonmember "helper" functions in
/// Teuchos_CommHelpers.hpp.  These methods are templated on the
/// <tt>Packet</tt> type, that is, the type of data you want to send
/// or receive.  For example, suppose you have two processes (with
/// ranks 0 and 1, respectively), and you want to send an array of
/// 10 <tt>double</tt> from Process 0 to Process 1.  Both processes have
/// defined <tt>RCP<const Comm<int> > comm</tt> as above.  Here is the
/// code on Process 0:
/// \code
/// const int count = 10; // Send 10 doubles
/// double values[10] = ...;
/// const int destinationRank = 1; // Send to Process 1
/// // You may be able to omit the template arguments of 'send' here.
/// Teuchos::send<int, double> (*comm, 10, values, destinationRank);
/// \endcode
/// Here is the code on Process 1:
/// \code
/// const int count = 10; // Receive 10 doubles
/// double values[10]; // Will be overwritten by receive
/// const int sourceRank = 0; // Receive from Process 0
/// // You may be able to omit the template arguments of 'receive' here.
/// Teuchos::receive<int, double> (*comm, sourceRank, 10, values);
/// \endcode
/// Please refer to the documentation in Teuchos_CommHelpers.hpp for
/// more details.
///
/// \section Teuchos_Comm_Former Former documentation
///
/// This interface is templated on the ordinal type but only deals with buffers
/// of untyped data represented as arrays <tt>char</tt> type. All reduction
/// operations that are initiated by the concreate communicator object are
/// performed by user-defined <tt>ReductOpBase</tt> objects.  It is the
/// responsibility of the <tt>ReductOpBase</tt> object to know what the currect
/// data type is, to perform casts or serializations/unserializations to and
/// from <tt>char[]</tt> buffers, and to know how to reduce the objects
/// correctly.  It is strictly up to the client to correctly convert data types
/// to <tt>char[]</tt> arrays but there is a great deal of helper code to make
/// this easy and safe.

  /**
   * \brief Duplicate this communicator.
   *
   * Make a copy of this communicator with a duplicate communication
   * space.  Note that the returned communicator has the same
   * properties (including process ranks, attributes and topologies)
   * as this communicator, but is distinct from the original.
   * "Distinct" means that if you send a message on the original
   * communicator, you can't receive it on the new one, and vice
   * versa.  The new communicator represents a separate message space.
   * This has the same semantics as MPI_Comm_dup.  (In fact, the
   * subclass MpiComm implements this using MPI_Comm_dup.)
   *
   * Most users don't want to do this.  The duplicate() method returns
   * a <i>new communicator</i>.  In MPI terms, it is a <i>different
   * MPI_Comm</i>.  If you want a shallow copy of the handle, you
   * should pass the <tt>Comm<Ordinal><tt> around by const pointer,
   * like this:
   * \code
   * RCP<const Comm<int> > comm = ...; // my original communicator
   * // ... do some stuff with comm ...
   * // Make a shallow copy.
   * RCP<const Comm<int> > diffHandleSameComm = comm;
   * // ... do some stuff with diffHandleSameComm ...
   * \endcode
   * This behaves the same as the following "raw MPI" code:
   * \code
   * MPI_Comm comm = ...; // my original communicator
   * // ... do some stuff with comm ...
   * // Make a shallow copy.
   * MPI_Comm diffHandleSameComm = comm;
   * // ... do some stuff with diffHandleSameComm ...
   * \endcode
   * The subclass of Comm ensures that the "raw" MPI handle is freed
   * only after the last reference to it by a subclass instance
   * disappears.  (It does reference counting underneath.)
   *
   * Please, please do not invoke the copy constructor or assignment
   * operator of Comm.  Of course it's not legal to do that anyway,
   * because Comm is pure virtual.  However, even if you could do it,
   * you must never do this!  For example, do <i>not</i> do this:
   * \code
   * RCP<const Comm<int> > comm = ...; // my original communicator
   * // ... do some stuff with comm ...
   * // DO NOT DO THIS, EVER!!!  THIS IS VERY BAD!!!
   * RCP<const Comm<int> > badComm (new Comm<int> (*comm));
   * \endcode
   * and do <i>not</i> do this:
   * \code
   * RCP<const Comm<int> > comm = ...; // my original communicator
   * // ... do some stuff with comm ...
   * // DO NOT DO THIS, EITHER!!!  THIS IS JUST AS BAD!!!
   * RCP<const Comm<int> > badComm = rcp (new Comm<int> (*comm));
   * \endcode
   * This is bad because it ignores the subclass' data.  Depending on
   * the subclass of Comm that you are actually using, it may be
   * appropriate to invoke the copy constructor or assignment operator
   * of the specific subclass, but <i>never</i> those of Comm itself.
   *
   * Users are not responsible for freeing the returned communicator.
   * The destructor of the subclass of Comm handles that itself.
   *
   * In an MPI implementation, the returned communicator is created
   * using MPI_Comm_dup, with the resulting semantic implications.
   *
   * \return A new communicator.
