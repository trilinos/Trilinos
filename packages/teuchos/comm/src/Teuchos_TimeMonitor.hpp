 * \brief Scope protection wrapper for Teuchos::Time, with timer reporting functionality.
 *
 * An instance of the Teuchos::TimeMonitor class wraps a nonconst
 * reference to a Teuchos::Time timer object.  TimeMonitor's
 * constructor starts the timer, and its destructor stops the timer.
 * This ensures scope safety of timers, so that no matter how a scope
 * is exited (whether the normal way or when an exception is thrown),
 * a timer started in the scope is stopped when the scope is left.
 *
 * TimeMonitor also has class methods that create or destroy timers
 * (in such a way that it can track the complete set of created timers
 * on each process) and compute global timer statistics.

  /// The typical use case for Time and TimeMonitor is that all

  /// list of computed statistics includes the minimum and maximum
  /// timing (and the corresponding call count for each) and the
  /// arithmetic mean (timing and call count).  This list may expand
  /// in the future.
  ///
  /// Different processes may have different sets of timers.  This
  /// method gives you two options for reconciling the sets.  If setOp
  /// is Intersection, it computes the intersection (the common
  /// subset) of timers on all processes in the communicator.
  /// Otherwise, if setOp is Union, this method computes the union of
  /// timers on all processes in the communicator.  Intersection is
  /// the default, since it means that all reported timers exist on
  /// all participating processes.  For setOp=Union, timers that do
  /// not exist on some processes will be given a zero timing and call
  /// count, so that statistics make sense.
  ///
  /// \note This method must called as a collective by all processes
  ///   in the communicator.
  ///
  /// All output arguments are returned redundantly on all processes
  /// in the communicator.  That makes this method an all-reduce.
  ///
  /// \section Teuchos_TimeMonitor_computeGlobalTimerStatistics_stats Statistics collected
  ///
  /// The "MinOverProcs" and "MaxOverProcs" timings are cumulative:
  /// the reported timing is for all calls.  Along with the min resp.
  /// max timing comes the call count of the process who had the min
  /// resp. max.  (If more than one process had the min resp. max
  /// timing, then the call count on the process with the smallest
  /// rank is reported.)
  ///
  /// The "MeanOverProcs" equals the sum of the processes' cumulative
  /// timings, divided by the number of processes.  Thus, it is
  /// cumulative over all calls, and is comparable with the
  /// "MinOverProcs" and "MaxOverProcs" timings.  This differs from
  /// the "MeanOverCallCounts" (see below).  This does <i>not</i>
  /// weight the mean by call counts.
  ///
  /// The "MeanOverCallCounts" is an arithmetic mean of all timings.
  /// It is <i>not</i> cumulative.  It reports the mean timing for a
  /// single invocation over all calls on all processes, not weighting
  /// any one process more than the others.  For each timer, this is
  /// the sum of the cumulative timing over all processes, divided by
  /// the sum of the call counts over all processes for that timing.
  /// (We compute it a bit differently to help prevent overflow.)  The
  /// "MeanOverCallCounts" is <i>not</i> comparable with the min, max,
  /// or "MeanOverProcs".
  ///
  /// We report with both versions of the mean timing the mean call
  /// count over processes.  This may be fractional, which is one
  /// reason why we report call counts as \c double rather than \c
  /// int.  It has no particular connection to the mean timing.

  /// at worst \f$O(N (\log N) (\log P))\f$ time along the critical
  /// path (i.e., on the "slowest process" in the communicator).  The

///
/// Classes and functions with the name "TimeMonitorSurrogate" in them
/// let CommandLineProcessor optionally call TimeMonitor::summarize(),
/// without needing to know that the TimeMonitor class exists.  This
/// allows Teuchos to put CommandLineProcessor in a separate package
/// from TimeMonitor.  We want to do this because TimeMonitor depends
/// on Comm, and is therefore in the TeuchosComm subpackage (which
/// depends on TeuchosCore), but CommandLineProcessor is in a
/// different subpackage which does not depend on Comm.
///
/// The TimeMonitorSurrogateImplInserter class' constructor ensures
/// that CommandLineProcessor gets informed about TimeMonitor even
/// before the program starts executing main().  This happens
/// automatically, without changes to main(), because we declare an
/// instance of this class in the header file.  If the TeuchosComm
/// subpackage was built and its libraries were linked in,
/// CommandLineProcessor will know about TimeMonitor.
///
/// \section Teuchos_TimeMonitorSurrogateImplInserter_Note Note to Teuchos developers
///
/// This is an instance of the
/// <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency injection</a>
/// design pattern.  CommandLineProcessor is not supposed to know
/// about TimeMonitor, because CommandLineProcessor's subpackage does
/// not depend on TimeMonitor's subpackage.  Thus,
/// CommandLineProcessor interacts with TimeMonitor through the
/// TimeMonitorSurrogate interface.  TimeMonitorSurrogateImplInserter
/// "injects" the dependency at run time, if the TeuchosComm
/// subpackage was enabled and the application linked with its
/// libraries.
///
/// Teuchos developers could imitate the pattern of this class in
/// order to use TimeMonitor's class methods (such as summarize())
/// from any other class that does not depend on the TeuchosComm
/// subpackage.
