\section Teuchos_startup Overview of Teuchos

Teuchos contains a number of classes.  These classes have been divided 
between a "standard" build and an "extended" build.  The "standard" build has shown to be 
a portable subset of the Teuchos tools and is built by default when Teuchos is enabled (<i>--enable-teuchos</i>).  
The "extended" build is also portable, but contains more special purpose tools like XML parsing and
communicators (<i>--enable-teuchos-extended</i>).

Additionally, boundschecking for some of the container classes can be enabled through configuring 
Trilinos with <i>--enable-teuchos-abc</i>.  <b>Boundschecking incurs a significant performance penalty and so is 
not recommended for production builds.</b>  To enable complex arithmetic in the computational classes, 
Teuchos must be configured with <i>--enable-teuchos-complex</i>.

\subsection Teuchos_sclasses Teuchos "Standard" Classes

<ul>

<li> <b>Low-level math</b>

  <ul>

  <li> Numerical scalar traits : Teuchos::ScalarTraits - a traits class defining basic propertys and elementary
  functions for various scalar data types to be used in numerical computations.

  <li> BLAS wrapper class: Teuchos::BLAS - A ``thin'' layer of C++ code wrapping the basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS).
       This class provides a single instance interface between Teuchos and the BLAS.  In this way we can easily
       switch BLAS interfaces and manage the C++/Fortran translation differences that exist between different
       computer systems.  This class also provides a very convenient
       way to templatize the BLAS.

  <li> LAPACK wrapper class: Teuchos::LAPACK - A ``thin'' layer of C++ code wrapping LAPACK.  Like Teuchos::BLAS,
       it provides nice C++ access to LAPACK.

  <li> Serial Dense Matrix class:  Teuchos::SerialDenseMatrix - A templated, dense rectangular matrix class that provides basic
       operations like addition, multiplication, scaling, logical comparison, norms, etc.  This class also provides support for a dense
       matrix that needs to be replicated across processors in a parallel application.  Teuchos::SerialDenseVector inherits from
       Teuchos::SerialDenseMatrix, providing some additional methods that are useful to dense vectors.  Boundschecking
       can be turned on at compile time with the
       <tt>--enable-teuchos-abc </tt> configure flag.

  </ul>

<li> <b> Parameter Options: </b>

  <ul>

  <li> Parameter Entry:  Teuchos::ParameterEntry - A structure that holds a Teuchos::any object as the value
       and information on the status of the parameter.  The type of parameter is chosen through the templated Set/Get methods.
       Teuchos::ParameterEntry object is held as the "value" in the Teuchos::ParameterList map.

  <li> Parameter List:  Teuchos::ParameterList - A templated parameter list which holds a map of <key,value> pairs, where the
       "value" is a Teuchos::ParameterEntry object and the "key" is a string object.  The type of parameter is chosen through
       the templated Set/Get methods, which allows it to be any standard type (float, double, int, ...) or another parameter list.

  <li> Commandline arguments: Teuchos::CommandLineProcessor - processes commandline arguments from (argc,argv[])
       in a validated manner and automatically generates a documented --help option. 

  </ul>

<li> <b> Memory Management: </b>

  <ul>

  <li> Teuchos::Ptr:  Light-weight smart pointer class for replacing the use
  if raw C++ pointers for pointing to a single object in funtion argument
  lists.  This is only for non-persisting relationships.

  <li> Teuchos::RCP: Reference-counted smart pointer class for managing
  dynamically allocated memory to single object that is safe under multiple
  inheritance.  This is only for persisting relationships.  See
  <a href="RefCountPtrBeginnersGuideSAND.pdf">this report</a>

  <li> Teuchos::ArrayRCP:  Reference-counted pointer for managing dynamically
  allocated array memory.  This is a general replacement for a raw C++ pointer
  to handle an array.  This is only for persisting relationships.

  <li> Teuchos::Array: is a templated array class similar to the STL vector,
  but with optional very strong debug-mode runtime checking.

  <li> Teuchos::ArrayView: A light-weight replacement for raw pointers for passing
  arrays into functions.  This is only for non-persisting relationships.

  <li> Teuchos::ConstNonconstObjectContainer: A simple wrapper class for
  implementing the "runtime protection of const" idiom.

  </ul>

  Runtime debug checking of the above classes can be turned on by setting
  <tt>-DTeuchos_ENABLE_DEBUG:BOOL=ON</tt> when configuring.  Also, strong runtime
  checking of reference counting including detection of circular RCPs,
  detection of duplicate owning RCPs, and detection of dangling non-owning RCPs
  can be turned on by also configuring with
  <tt>-DTeuchos_ENABLE_DEBUG_RCP_NODE_TRACING:BOOL=ON</tt>.  Without these
  configure options, all of these classes are configured by default to
  be as efficient as possible.

<li> <b> Low-Level Language Support: </b>

  <ul>

  <li> Abstract factories:
    <ul>
    <li> Teuchos::AbstractFactory - defines a basic "Abstract Factory" interface
         that allocates objects and returns them wrapped in <tt>Teuchos::RCP</tt>
         objects.
    <li> Teuchos::AbstractFactoryStd - defines a general concrete implementation of 
         Teuchos::AbstractFactory that allows creating quick concrete subclass
         implementations for concrete types.
    </ul>

  <li> Dynamic casting: Teuchos::dyn_cast - a wrapper for
  <tt>dynamic_cast<></tt> that throws <tt>std::bad_cast</tt>
  exceptions with very detailed error messages on what types are involved.

  <li> Array argument call generation : \ref Teuchos_Array_Arguments "arrayArg()" - a set of overloaded
  templated functions for generating inline array arguments for
  function calls.

  <li><tt>Teuchos::getConst()</tt> is a silly little templated function that returns a
  constant reference given any constant object.  This function allows a piece of code
  to access the <tt>const</tt> version of a member function given a non-<tt>const</tt> reference
  to an object.

  </ul>

<li> <b> Outputting support </b>

  <ul>

  <li><tt>Teuchos::FancyOStream</tt> wraps any <tt>std::ostream</tt> object and
  produces nicely indented outputting.  It can also add prefixes to each line
  of output such as the processor rank.

  <li><tt>Teuchos::OSTab</tt> is used in conjunction with a
  <tt>Teuchos::FancyOStream</tt> object to generate exception safe indentation
  control as well as set other information related to the line prefix.

  <li><tt>Teuchos::VerboseObject</tt> is a base class that objects can inherit
  from that makes producing coordinated informative outputting easier.  This
  class can be inherited by any C++ subclass without requiring any function
  overrides but to be useful the class object must use the embedded ostream
  and verbosity level to print its activities.

  <li><tt>Teuchos::oblackholestream</tt> is a concrete subclass of <tt>std::ostream</tt>
  that ignores all output.  This class is very useful in writing SPMD parallel programs
  and controlling which processor(s) produce output.  Generally only the the root process
  uses a real <tt>std::ostream</tt> object while all of the slave processors use
  a <tt>Teuchos::oblackholestream</tt> for console output.

  <li> <tt>Teuchos::Describable</tt> defines an interface that
  subclasses can override that allows the creation of formated
  output of an object's state complete with indentation control.
  This class has default definitions for all of its virtual member
  functions and therefore can be inherited by existing C++ classes
  without requiring any additional implementation support to get
  started.

  </ul>

<li> <b> Performance Monitoring </b>

  <ul>

  <li> Timing class: Teuchos::TimeMonitor - Provides timing functions for the
       purposes of performance analysis. 

  <li> Floating point operation class: Teuchos::Flops - Provides floating point operations (FLOPS)
       counting and reporting functions for the purposes of performance analysis.  All Teuchos computational
       classes accumulate FLOP counts associated with the \e this object of the computations.

  </ul>

<li> <b> Exception Handling </b>

  <ul>

  <li> Testing for Exceptions: The TEST_FOR_EXCEPTION() macro accepts a
  logical test, an exception handler, and a
  message.  It then throws an "intelligent" exception informing the
  user of the file, line, and message where
  the exception was thrown.  The macro TEST_FOR_EXCEPT() is a shorter
  macro that just accepts a logic test and is therefore easier to write.
  Please use TEST_FOR_EXCEPT(!test) as an alternative to assert(test).

  </ul>

<li> <b> Testing Support </b>

  Teuchos contains some utilities that make it easier to write tests

  See \ref teuchos_testing_grp

</ul>

\subsection Teuchos_eclasses Teuchos "Extended" Classes

<ul>

<li> <b> Containers </b>

<ul>

<li> Teuchos::Hashtable is a templated map with constant-time lookup.

<li> Teuchos::HashSet is a templated set with constant-time lookup.

</ul>

<br>
<li> <b> XML </b>
<ul>

<li> Teuchos::XMLObject is an object representation of a subset of XML data. Supported XML features
are tags, attributes, and character content. 

<li> Teuchos::FileInputSource can read XML from a file and produce a Teuchos::XMLObject

<li> Teuchos::StringInputSource can read XML from a character string and produce a Teuchos::XMLObject

</ul>

<br>
<li> <b> MPI </b>
<ul>

<li> Teuchos::MPISession has methods to initialize, finalize, and query the global MPI environment.

<li> Teuchos::MPIComm represents an MPI communicator

<li> Teuchos::MPIContainerComm has methods to communicate Teuchos::Array objects

</ul>

</ul>
