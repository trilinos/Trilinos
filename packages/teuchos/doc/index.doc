\section Teuchos_intro Introduction

Teuchos provides a suite of common tools for many Trilinos packages.
These tools include memory management classes such as "smart" pointers
and arrays, "parameter lists" for communicating hierarchical lists of
parameters between library or application layers, templated wrappers
for the BLAS and LAPACK, XML parsers, and other utilities.  They
provide a unified "look and feel" across Trilinos packages, and help
avoid common programming mistakes.

We encourage the addition of new utilities to Teuchos.  Please contact
the Teuchos developer team (see below for contact information) if you
would like to share your utility.

\section Teuchos_config_options Summary of Teuchos' Configuration Options

Teuchos has several different build options which change its behavior.
You must set these options before building Trilinos, when configuring
the build using CMake.

<ul>
<li> <b>Bounds checking:</b> You may enable bounds checking and other
  safety checks for some of the memory management and container
  classes by setting the <tt>Teuchos_ENABLE_DEBUG:BOOL=ON</tt> CMake 
  option.  Bounds checking is off by default.  It incurs a significant
  performance penalty and so is not recommended for production builds.

<li> <b>Complex arithmetic:</b> Teuchos does not support complex
  arithmetic (the std::complex template class) by default.  This saves
  build time and makes libraries smaller.  To enable support for
  complex arithmetic, set the <tt>Teuchos_ENABLE_COMPLEX:BOOL=ON</tt> 
  CMake option.
</ul>

\section Teuchos_startup Overview of Teuchos Subpackages

Teuchos contains several different types of software.  These different
collections are organized into different subpackages.

\subsection TeuchosCore_src Teuchos Core Subpackage

The Teuchos Core subpackage (<tt>Trilinos_ENABLE_TeuchosCore:BOOL=ON</tt>) 
contains basic, general-purpose utilities.

<ul>

<li> <b> Memory Management: </b>

  For a detailed description of the Teuchos memory management classes, see the
  report <a href="TeuchosMemoryManagementSAND.pdf">Teuchos C++ Memory
  Management Classes, Idioms, and Related Topics: The Complete Reference</a>.
  An abbreviated table of contents can be found in the Preface of the
  document.

  The classes are:

  <ul>

  <li> Teuchos::Ptr:  Light-weight smart pointer class for replacing the use
  of raw C++ pointers for pointing to a single object in funtion argument
  lists.  This is only for non-persisting relationships.

  <li> Teuchos::RCP: Reference-counted smart pointer class for
  managing dynamically allocated memory to a single object.
  Teuchos::RCP is safe under multiple inheritance.  This is only for
  persisting relationships.  Please refer to the 
  <a href="RefCountPtrBeginnersGuideSAND.pdf">Teuchos::RCP Beginner's Guide</a>.

  <li> Teuchos::ArrayRCP: Reference-counted smart pointer class for
  managing dynamically allocated arrays.  This is a general
  replacement for a raw C++ pointer to handle an array.  This is only
  for persisting relationships.

  <li> Teuchos::ArrayView: Light-weight replacement for raw pointers for
  passing arrays into functions.  This is only for non-persisting
  relationships.

  <li> Teuchos::Array: Templated array class idential to the STL vector,
  but with optional very strong debug-mode runtime checking and full
  integration with the other array types here.

  <li> Teuchos::Tuple: Compile-time sized array class.

  <li> Teuchos::ConstNonconstObjectContainer: A simple wrapper class for
  implementing the "runtime protection of const" idiom.

  </ul>

  All the Teuchos memory management classes are configured by default
  to be as efficient as possible.  When building Trilinos, you may set
  configure options to enable various run-time correctness and safety
  checks.  These options are OFF by default, for maximum performance.

  You may turn on run-time debug checking in the above classes by
  setting the <tt>-D Teuchos_ENABLE_DEBUG:BOOL=ON</tt> CMake option at
  configure time.  You may also turn on strong run-time checking of
  reference counting, including
  <ul>
  <li> Detection of circular references
  <li> Detection of duplicate owning references
  <li> Detection of dangling nonowning references
  </ul>
  by setting the 
  <tt>-D Teuchos_ENABLE_DEBUG_RCP_NODE_TRACING:BOOL=ON</tt> CMake option.
  In order to get the strongest debug-mode run-time checking, you must also
  enable support for <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> by setting
  the <tt>-D Teuchos_ENABLE_BOOST=ON</tt> and building Trilinos against an 
  installation of Boost.

<li> <b> Low-Level Language Support: </b>

  <ul>

  <li> Abstract factories:
    <ul>
    <li> Teuchos::AbstractFactory - defines a basic "Abstract Factory" interface
         that allocates objects and returns them wrapped in <tt>Teuchos::RCP</tt>
         objects.
    <li> Teuchos::AbstractFactoryStd - defines a general concrete implementation of 
         Teuchos::AbstractFactory that allows creating quick concrete subclass
         implementations for concrete types.
    </ul>

  <li> Dynamic casting: Teuchos::dyn_cast - a wrapper for
  <tt>dynamic_cast<></tt> that throws <tt>std::bad_cast</tt>
  exceptions with very detailed error messages on what types are involved.

  <li> <tt>Teuchos::getConst()</tt> is a simple templated function
  that returns a constant reference, given a nonconst reference.  This
  function allows a piece of code to access the <tt>const</tt> version
  of a member function given a non-<tt>const</tt> reference to an
  object.

  </ul>

<li> <b> Output support </b>

  <ul>

  <li><tt>Teuchos::FancyOStream</tt> wraps any <tt>std::ostream</tt> object and
  produces nicely indented outputting.  It can also add prefixes to each line
  of output such as the processor rank.

  <li><tt>Teuchos::OSTab</tt> is used in conjunction with a
  <tt>Teuchos::FancyOStream</tt> object to generate exception-safe
  indentation control, as well as to set other information related to
  the line prefix.

  <li> <tt>Teuchos::Describable</tt> defines an interface that objects
  may implement in order to make them self-descriptive.  It allows the
  creation of formated output of an object's state complete with
  indentation control.  This class has default definitions for all of
  its virtual member functions, but to be useful, subclasses should
  override at least the description() method.

  <li><tt>Teuchos::VerboseObject</tt> is an interface that objects may
  implement in order to let them describe what they are doing as they
  are doing it, with a user-specified verbosity level.  Any C++ class
  may inherit from this without requiring any function overrides, but
  to be useful the class object must use the embedded output stream
  and verbosity level to print its activities.

  <li><tt>Teuchos::oblackholestream</tt> is a concrete subclass of
  <tt>std::ostream</tt> that ignores all output.  (Output "disappears"
  into a "black hole.")  This class is very useful in writing SPMD
  parallel programs and controlling which process(es) produce output.
  Generally only the the root process uses a real
  <tt>std::ostream</tt> object while the other processes use a
  <tt>Teuchos::oblackholestream</tt> for console output.

  </ul>

<li> <b> Exception Handling </b>

  <ul>

  <li> <em>Testing for Exceptions</em>: The TEUCHOS_TEST_FOR_EXCEPTION() macro accepts
  a logical test, an exception handler, and a message.  It then throws
  an "intelligent" exception informing the user of the file, line, and
  message where the exception was thrown.  The macro
  TEUCHOS_TEST_FOR_EXCEPT() is a shorter macro that just accepts a
  logic test and is therefore easier to write.  Please use
  TEUCHOS_TEST_FOR_EXCEPT(!test) as a safer, more informative
  alternative to assert(test).</li>

  <li> <em>Stack Tracing</em>: When a debug build is enabled
  (CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG OR Trilinos_ENABLE_DEBUG=ON) and when using GCC and
  when enabling BinUtils (TPL_ENABLE_BinUtils=ON) then the
  TEUCHOS_TEST_FOR_EXCEPTION() family of macros
  will take snapshopts of the stacktrace when exceptions are thrown.  These
  stacktraces can be printed out after an exception is thrown using the
  funciton Teuchos::get_stored_stacktrace().  The standard catch macro
  TEUCHOS_STANDARD_CATCH_STATEMENTS() automatically invokes this function so
  all main() programs written using this macro will automatically print out
  stack trace information when uncaught exceptions are encountered.  A program
  can also cause strack tracing info to be printed when an segfault occurs by
  calling Teuchos::print_stack_on_segfault() before main() runs.  More fine
  tuning of stacktracing can be controlled at configure time using the CMake
  options Teuchos_ENABLE_STACKTRACE and Teuchos_ENABLE_DEFAULT_STACKTRACE.
  When Teuchos_ENABLE_STACKTRACE=ON, then stracktracing of exceptions can be
  turned on and off at runtime using the function
  Teuchos::TestForException_setEnableStacktrace().  The configure varible
  Teuchos_ENABLE_DEFAULT_STACKTRACE determines if stack tracing is on or off
  by defualt at runtime.

  NOTE: Stacktracing is always off by default in any build type except
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG and/or Trilinos_ENABLE_DEBUG=ON.  Therefore,
  by default an optimized build of the code will never have stack
  tracking enabled and will suffer no performance penalty due to stack
  tracing.  It is just debug builds that it is enabled for (and then
  only by default; it can be disabled even for a debug build).

  NOTE: Stacktracing is only enabled when the using GCC and when the binutils
  libraries are available (see teuchos/CMakeLists.txt and cmake configure
  output for details).

  <b>WARNING:</b> Printing stacktraces can be very
  expensive if your program throws a lot of exceptions.  Therefore, the
  testing infrastructure for Trilinos with the checkin-test.py script turns
  off stack tracing by default by configuring with
  Teuchos_ENABLE_DEFAULT_STACKTRACE=OFF.

  </li>

  </ul>

<li> <b> Containers </b>

  <ul>
  <li> Teuchos::Hashtable is a templated dictionary (set of
    (key,value) pairs) with constant-time lookup for any key.
  <li> Teuchos::HashSet is a templated set with constant-time lookup.
  </ul>

<li> <b> Testing Unit Support </b>

  Teuchos contains some utilities that make it easier to write unit tests.
  See the native \ref Teuchos_UnitTest_grp "Unit Testing Support Code".

<li> Numerical scalar traits : Teuchos::ScalarTraits - a traits class
  defining basic properties and elementary functions for various
  scalar data types to be used in numerical computations.

</ul>


\subsection TeuchosParameterList_src Teuchos ParameterList Subpackage

The Teuchos ParameterList subpackage
(Trilinos_ENABLE_TeuchosParameterList=ON) contains the
Teuchos::ParameterList class and related utilities.  The
Teuchos::ParameterList class is a serializable hierarchical object
database.  Many Trilinos packages let users specify run-time options
and flags as a Teuchos::ParameterList.  They also use it internally to
pass information between different software layers.

<ul>

<li> <b> Parameter Options: </b>

  <ul>

  <li> Parameter Entry: Teuchos::ParameterEntry - A structure that
       holds a Teuchos::any object as the value and information on the
       status of the parameter.  The type of parameter is chosen
       through the templated set/get methods.  Teuchos::ParameterEntry
       object is held as the "value" in the Teuchos::ParameterList
       map.

  <li> Parameter List: Teuchos::ParameterList - A templated parameter
       list which holds a map of (key,value) pairs, where the "value"
       is a Teuchos::ParameterEntry object and the "key" is a string.
       The type of parameter is chosen through the templated set/get
       methods, which allows it to have any type.  This includes
       standard types such as float, double, or int, another parameter
       list, or any desired type.

  <li> Command-line arguments: Teuchos::CommandLineProcessor -
       processes command-line arguments from (argc,argv[]) in a
       validated manner and automatically generates a documented
       "--help" command-line option.

  </ul>

<li> <b> XML </b>

  <ul>
  
  <li> Teuchos::XMLObject is an object representation of a subset of XML data. Supported XML features
  are tags, attributes, and character content. 
  
  <li> Teuchos::FileInputSource can read XML from a file and produce a Teuchos::XMLObject
  
  <li> Teuchos::StringInputSource can read XML from a character string and produce a Teuchos::XMLObject
  
  </ul>

</ul>


\subsection TeuchosComm_src Teuchos Communication Subpackage

The Teuchos Comm subpackage (Trilinos_ENABLE_TeuchosComm=ON) contains support
for SPMD parallel programs and useful utilities that depend on these.

<ul>

<li> <b>Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD)</b>

  <ul>
  <li> Teuchos::Comm provides an abstract interface to a small subset
  of the Message Passing Interface (MPI), whether or not Trilinos was
  actually built with MPI support.

  <li> Teuchos::MpiComm is a subclass of Teuchos::Comm that uses MPI.

  <li> Teuchos::SerialComm is a subclass of Teuchos::Comm for
  single-process programs.  It works whether or not Trilinos was built
  with MPI support.
  </ul>

<li> <b> Performance Monitoring </b>

  <ul>
  <li> Teuchos::Time: A platform-independent timer implementation.
    This may be used either by itself, or in combination with
    Teuchos::TimeMonitor for tracking global timer statistics over
    processes.
  
  <li> Teuchos::TimeMonitor: A class that automates (and makes
    exception safe) the process of starting and stopping timers, lets
    users create timers that are automatically registered and tracked,
    and provides functions for computing timer statistics over any
    given set of parallel processes.

  <li> Teuchos::Flops - Provides functions that count and report the
    number of executed floating-point operations (flop).  Many Teuchos
    computational classes accumulate flop counts associated with the
    \e this object of the computations.
  </ul>

</ul>


\subsection TeuchosNumerics_src Teuchos Numerics Subpackage

The Teuchos Numerics subpackage (Trilinos_ENABLE_TeuchosNumerics=ON) contains
BLAS and LAPACK C++ wrappers and C++ classes that use these for dense serial
matrices and vectors.

<ul>

<li> BLAS wrapper class: Teuchos::BLAS - A ``thin'' layer of C++ code wrapping the basic linear algebra subprograms (BLAS).
     This class provides a single instance interface between Teuchos and the BLAS.  In this way we can easily
     switch BLAS interfaces and manage the C++/Fortran translation differences that exist between different
     computer systems.  This class also provides a very convenient
     way to templatize the BLAS.

<li> LAPACK wrapper class: Teuchos::LAPACK - A ``thin'' layer of C++ code wrapping LAPACK.  Like Teuchos::BLAS,
     it provides nice C++ access to LAPACK.

<li> Serial Dense Matrix class:  Teuchos::SerialDenseMatrix - A templated dense matrix class.  It provides basic
     operations like addition, multiplication, scaling, logical comparison, norms, etc.  This class also provides support for a dense
     matrix that needs to be replicated across processors in a parallel application.  Teuchos::SerialDenseVector inherits from
     Teuchos::SerialDenseMatrix, providing some additional methods that are useful to dense vectors.  Bounds checking
     can be turned on at compile time with the
     <tt>Teuchos_ENABLE_DEBUG=ON</tt> configure flag.

</ul>


\subsection TeuchosRemainder_src Teuchos Remainder Subpackage

The Teuchos Remainder subpackage (Trilinos_ENABLE_TeuchosRemainder=ON)contains
left over stuff that does not fit will into the above subpackages or is slated
to be deprecated and removed.


\section Teuchos_browser Browse all of Teuchos

You can browse all of Teuchos as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>.  This is not the recommended way to learn
about Teuchos software.  However, it is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of Teuchos</a> or to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate specific files</a>.

*/


/** \defgroup Teuchos_Deprecated_grp Deprecated Teuchos Code

All of the code that shows up here is deprecated and should not be used by
clients (because it will be removed at some point).

*/


/** \defgroup Teuchos_UnitTest_grp Unit Testing Support

Teuchos contains simple but effective native unit testing support.
Unit tests can be defined in separate files.  This can be as simple
as:

\code

// Int_UnitTests.cpp

#include "Teuchos_UnitTestHarness.hpp"

namespace {

TEUCHOS_UNIT_TEST( Int, Basic )
{
  int i1 = 5;
  TEST_EQUALITY_CONST( i1, 5 );
}

TEUCHOS_UNIT_TEST( Int, Assignment )
{
  int i1 = 4;
  int i2 = i1;
  TEST_EQUALITY( i2, i1 );
}

} // namespace

\endcode

and then compiled along with other unit testing definition files into
executables along with a simple main function like:

\code

// UnitTestMain.cpp

#include "Teuchos_UnitTestRepository.hpp"
#include "Teuchos_GlobalMPISession.hpp"

int main( int argc, char* argv[] )
{
  Teuchos::GlobalMPISession mpiSession(&argc, &argv);
  return Teuchos::UnitTestRepository::runUnitTestsFromMain(argc, argv);
}

\endcode

using CMake code like:

\code

PACKAGE_ADD_EXECUTABLE_AND_TEST(
  MyUnitTests
  SOURCES
    UnitTestMain.cpp
    Int_UnitTests.cpp
    ... other unit test files ...
  STANDARD_PASS_OUTPUT
  )

\endcode

Once the Unit test exectuable is built, it will run with CTest automatically and
produce output indicating which tests passed or failed.  It is just run as:

\verbatim
  ./MyPackage_MyUnitTest.exe
\endverbatim

One of the most useful properties of this simple unit testing support code
is that the unit testing exectuable (created by the above CMake code)
accepts command-line arguments for showing more or less output, runing only
particular sets of tests, etc.  Just pass in the <tt>--help</tt> flag to see all
of the options as:

\verbatim
  ./MyPackage_MyUnitTest.exe --help
\endverbatim

Now learn about unit tests, for example, at:

  http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/oracle/utplsql/news/fulldoc.html

References for Teuchos Unit Testing Support:

<ul>

<li> \ref Teuchos_UnitTestDefinitionMacros_grp "Unit Testing Definition
Macros": Macros used to define individual unit test blocks line TEUCHOS_UNIT_TEST().

<li> \ref Teuchos_UnitTestAssertMacros_grp "Unit Testing Assert Macros": Used
within a given unit test to individual statement-level checks like
TEST_EQUALITY().

</ul>

Suggestions for unit testing:

<ul>

<li> Put all unit tests for a given class <tt>MyClass</tt> into a single
file with the name <tt>MyClass_UnitTests.cpp</tt>.  This makes the unit
tests for a class easy to find and maintain.

<li> Aggregate unit tests for related classes and functionality into single
executables.  Putting lots of related unit tests in the same exectuable
ensures the process startup and shutdown for a given exectuable run by CTest
does not overwelm the cost of the the actual unit tests.  If well defined,
you can run thousands of unit tests in a single exectuable in a fraction of
a second.

<li> Don't bother writing you own simple UnitTestMain.cpp like above, just include the standard
one <tt>teuchos/core/test/UnitTest/Teuchos_StandardUnitTestMain.cpp</tt> in your
PACKAGE_ADD_EXECUTABLE_AND_TEST(...) CMake macro.  If you are using a TriBITS build in a downstream package, you can just use the global CMake varible <tt>${TEUCHOS_STD_UNIT_TEST_MAIN}</tt>.

<li> For parallel tests (using MPI), you can turn on automatic reductions across processes of pass/fail.  To enable this by default for your unit tests, use the standard main source file <tt>teuchos/comm/test/UnitTesting/Teuchos_StandardParallelUnitTestMain.cpp</tt> and see the option <tt>Teuchos::UnitTestRepository::setGloballyReduceTestResult()</tt>.  If you are using a TriBITS build in a downstream package, you can just use the global CMake varible <tt>${TEUCHOS_STD_PARALLEL__UNIT_TEST_MAIN}</tt>.

<li> When doing Test-Driven Development (TDD), write a single unit
test at a time (fail, pass, refactor) and constantly be rebuilding and
rerunning the unit test executable.

<li> Get an idea of all the different ways you can write unit tests by
searching for unit test examples in Trilinos by doing:

\verbatim
$ find . -name "*" -exec grep -l 'TEUCHOS_UNIT_TEST' {} \;
\endverbatim

Just open a bunch of those files and see how people use these unit testing tools.

Search packages like Teuchos, Tpetra, and Thyra first since these are the most numerous
and mature unit testing examples you will find in Trilinos.

</ul>
