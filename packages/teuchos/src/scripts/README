makeMpiTypeTraits.py: 

This is a Python script for automatic code generation of the
MpiTypeTraits traits class and its specializations.  The script is
meant only for Trilinos developers, to automate the process of writing
code for certain tedious tasks (in this case, specializing a traits
class for many different built-in C++ types).

It is not currently meant to run as part of the normal Trilinos build
process.  A Trilinos developer would execute the script manually to
generate code, move the resulting files (Teuchos_MpiTypeTraits.hpp and
Teuchos_MpiTypeTraits.cpp) into teuchos/src, and then check the
resulting code into the source repository.  This appears to be common
practice among different Trilinos packages (such as MueLu, which also
automates code generation of specializations in this way).

The C++ files (ending in .hpp or .cpp) in this directory are not meant
to be built or used as header files; they are only for use by the
Python scripts.  They provide either verbatim source code (with
documentation) or fill-in-the-blank string templates for the scripts.

All files in this directory are subject to the same open-source
license as the Teuchos package.  Please refer to teuchos/Copyright.txt
for license details.  Interested users are welcome to examine the
scripts in this directory, subject to the terms of this license.

MpiTypeTraits-users-guide.org: A users' guide for the MpiTypeTraits
traits class that maps from C++ type to its corresponding MPI_Datatype
and count.  It is a plain text file best viewed using Emacs' org-mode.
