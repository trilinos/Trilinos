///
/// Tpetra::Details::getLinearSolver,
/// Tpetra::Details::registerLinearSolverFactory, and
/// Tpetra::Details::LinearSolverFactory implement the Dependency
/// Inversion and Injection (DII) pattern, as applied to "linear
/// solvers."  A linear solver solves or helps solve linear system(s)
/// AX=B.  Examples include sparse direct solvers, iterative solvers,
/// and preconditioners for iterative solvers.
///
/// DII naturally admits hierarchical run-time options, as in e.g.,
/// Teuchos::ParameterList.  This lets solvers create inner solvers in
/// an arbitrarily nested way, following the arbitrary nesting of the
/// Teuchos::ParameterList.
///
/// DII works well when a ParameterList can express all the data that
/// a solver might need.  However, some solvers need or may benefit
/// from additional data.  For example, algebraic multigrid can use
/// mesh coordinates, and a sparse factorization can use an initial
/// permutation.  Such data do not fit naturally in a
/// Teuchos::ParameterList.
///
/// \note To developers: The LinearSolver and LinearSolverFactory
///   interfaces, and the LinearSolverFactoryRepository interface and
///   implementation must live in the bottom-most (most upstream)
///   package from all solvers that depend on it.  Solver defines an
///   interface for a solver, and LinearSolverFactory defines an
///   interface for a "factory" that knows how to create solvers.
///   Each solver package defines its own solvers, and its own factory
///   that knows how to create all the solvers in a given package.

/// Every package that implements solvers needs to implement a

/// If you have a compelling use case that requires explicit

/// about adding a deregisterLinearSolverFactory() function (which
/// does not exist yet).
///
/// In the Tpetra solver stack, it's necessary to register factories
/// for all combinations of template parameters that applications plan
/// to use.  The easiest way to do that is to hook into the explicit
/// template instantiation (ETI) system of each package.  If ETI is
/// ON, this is easy.  If ETI is OFF, it's a bit harder.  Tpetra
/// defines a set of template parameter combinations over which it
/// _tests_.  If ETI is ON, this is always a subset of the ETI set.
/// If ETI is OFF, I would recommend using this set of test types for
/// registering factories.  Do the following:
///
/// 1. Include TpetraCore_ETIHelperMacros.h (a header file that
///    Tpetra's CMake configuration process generates and writes to
///    the build directory)
///
/// 2. In an anonymous outer namespace, define a class that registers
///    your factory in its constructor.  See PackageA.cpp in
///    ../example/SolverFactory for an example.  Then, define a macro
///    that creates an instance of that class (see the bottom of
///    PackageA.cpp).
///
/// 3. In the same anonymous outer namespace, invoke the
///    TPETRA_ETI_MANGLING_TYPEDEFS() macro to define typedefs used

///
/// 4. In the same anonymous outer namespace, use the

/// \tparam NormType Type of the norm of the residual.  See the
///   documentation of LinearSolver for details.
///
/// \param packageName [in] Name of the package registering the
///   factory.  Package names are case sensitive.
/// \param factory [in] That package's factory.
///
/// This function lets packages register themselves, so that
/// getLinearSolver() (see above) can create solvers from that
/// package.  A package "registers itself" by doing the following:
/// <ol>
///   <li> Defining a concrete LinearSolverFactory subclass,
///        that knows how to create solvers from that package </li>
///   <li> Calling registerLinearSolverFactory() (this function) with
///        an instance of that LinearSolverFactory subclass </li>
/// </ol>
///
/// Packages may call this function before main() runs.  In fact, we
/// prefer that they do so.  This ensures that any package will be
/// able to create solvers from that package, without users or other
/// packages needing to know about that package.  When people talk
/// about "dependency injection" or "dependency inversion," this is
/// what they mean.
///
/// This function is templated with the same template parameters as
/// LinearSolverFactory.  This means that it must be called for every
/// combination of types (MV, OP) for which code will instantiate a
/// LinearSolverFactory<MV, OP, NormType>.  Thus, if the solver package wants to
/// do this before main() runs, it needs a list of all type
/// combination in advance.  If using explicit template instantiation
/// (ETI), you may plug this into the ETI system.  We thus recommend
/// that packages that use ETI register a LinearSolverFactory instance
/// for each ETI type combination.  For example, Ifpack2 should
/// iterate over all enabled combinations of the four template
/// parameters S, LO, GO, NT of Ifpack2::Preconditioner, creating a
/// LinearSolverFactory<MV, OP, NormType> instance for each combination, with MV
/// = Tpetra::MultiVector<S, LO, GO, NT> and OP = Tpetra::Operator<S,
/// LO, GO, NT>.  Package developers may find it useful to write a
/// macro that does this for that package's LinearSolverFactory
/// subclass.
///
/// If packages do not register a factory for certain type
/// combinations that users need, users may in rare instances need to
/// call this function themselves.  Avoid doing this, because it
/// defeats dependency inversion.
///
/// It could very well be that some packages don't implement all
/// desired type combinations MV, OP.  In that case, those packages
/// would not register a factory for those types.  Users who request
/// solvers from those packages for forbidden type combinations would
/// get a run-time error.
///
/// \note To developers: LinearSolverFactory returns LinearSolver by
///   Teuchos::RCP because Trilinos' solvers tend to use Teuchos::RCP,
///   and we don't want to break compatibility.  However, if C++11 is
///   enabled, we use std::shared_ptr to handle LinearSolverFactory
///   instances.  This is because that is an implementation detail
///   that solvers themselves don't have to see, and because
///   std::shared_ptr is thread safe.
