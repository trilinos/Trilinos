  /*! This function takes any matrix that implements the Epetra_MultiVector interface and writes it
      to the specified file.  The matrix can be distributed or serial.  This function is a convenience wrapper 
      around MultiVectorToMatrixMarketFile.  The following Matlab commands can be used to read the resulting file
      and convert to it to a Matlab sparse matrix:
      <ol>
      <li> load \e filename;
      </ol>
      For example:
