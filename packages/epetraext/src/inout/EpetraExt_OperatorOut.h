  //! Writes an Epetra_Operator object to a Matrix Market format file, forming the coefficients by applying the operator to the e_j vectors.
  /*! This function takes any linear operator that implements the Epetra_Operator interface and writes it
      to the specified file.  The operator can be distributed or serial.  The user can provide
      a strings containing the matrix name, a matrix description, and specify that header information
      should or should not be printed to the file.

      The coeffients are formed by applying the operator to the canonical vectors 
      \f[ e_j = (0, \ldots, 0, 1, 0, \ldots, 0) \f]
      where the value 1 appears in the the jth entry.  The number of canonical vectors used is determined by the size of the 
      OperatorDomainMap() and the lengths by the size of OperatorRangeMap().

      \param filename (In) A filename, including path if desired.  If a file with this name already exists,
                      it will be deleted.  On exit, this file will contained any requested header information
		      followed by the matrix coefficients.  The file will contain a row for each matrix entry
		      The first column is the global row index, using base 1, the second column is the global
		      column index of the entry, the third value is the matrix value for that entry.
      \param A (In) An Epetra_Operator Object containing the implicit user matrix to be dumped to file.  Any object
                    that implements the Epetra_Operator interface can be passed in.  In particular, the 
		    Epetra_CrsMatrix, Epetra_VbrMatrix, Epetra_FECrsMatrix, Epetra_FEVbrMatrix and Epetra_MsrMatrix
		    classes are compatible with this interface, as is AztecOO_Operator, all Ifpack and ML preconditioners.
      \param matrixName (In) A C-style string pointer to a name that will be stored in the comment field of the file.
                         This is not a required argument.  Note that it is possible to pass in the method A.Label().
      \param matrixDescription (In) A C-style string pointer to a matrix description that will be stored in the comment 
                                    field of the file.
      \param writeHeader (In) If true, the header will be written, otherwise only the matrix entries will be written.

      \return Returns 0 if no error, -1 if any problems with file system.

      <ol>
      <li> load \e filename;
