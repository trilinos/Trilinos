      a strings containing the matrix name, a matrix description, and specify that header information
      should or should not be printed to the file.

      \param filename (In) A filename, including path if desired.  If a file with this name already exists,

		      followed by the matrix coefficients.  The file will contain a row for each matrix entry
		      The first column is the global row index, using base 1, the second column is the global
		      column index of the entry, the third value is the matrix value for that entry.

		    Epetra_CrsMatrix, Epetra_VbrMatrix, Epetra_FECrsMatrix, Epetra_FEVbrMatrix and Epetra_MsrMatrix
		    classes are compatible with this interface.
      \param matrixName (In) A C-style std::string pointer to a name that will be stored in the comment field of the file.
                         This is not a required argument.  Note that it is possible to pass in the method A.Label() if 
			 the matrix is one of the four types: Epetra_CrsMatrix, Epetra_VbrMatrix, Epetra_FECrsMatrix, 
			 Epetra_FEVbrMatrix.
      \param matrixDescription (In) A C-style std::string pointer to a matrix description that will be stored in the comment 
                                    field of the file.
      \param writeHeader (In) If true, the header will be written, otherwise only the matrix entries will be written.

      \return Returns 0 if no error, -1 if any problems with file system.

      <ol>
      <li> load \e filename;
      <li> matrix_name = spconvert(filename_root);
