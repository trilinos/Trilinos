\section intro Introduction
EpetraExt is a set of extensions to Epetra.  To allow Epetra to remain
focused on it's primary functionality as a Linear Algebra object support,
EpetraExt was created to maintain additional support for such capabilities
as transformations (permutions, sub-block views, etc.), coloring support,
partitioning (Zoltan), and I/O.

\section startup Overview of EpetraExt.

\subsection formulations EpetraExt Classes

EpetraExt contains a number of classes.  They can be categorized as follows:

<ul> 

<li> EpetraExt::MatrixMatrix: Static Matrix Matrix Operations including Multiply and Add.

<li> Transforms: These classes derive from EpetraExt::Transform<T,U> allowing a common
     interface for transformation of epetra objects and migration of associated 
     data.

<ol>

<li> EpetraExt::Transform<T,U>: Abstract base for transformation of object of type T
     to object of type U.


<li> EpetraExt::Transform_Composite<T>: Allows the additive composition of 
     EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform<T>'s.

<li> Convertors: EpetraExt::LinearProblem_GraphTrans and EpetraExt::LinearProblem_MatrixTrans
     converts a EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform<Epetra_CrsGraph> and
     EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform<Epetra_CrsMatrix> to a EpetraExt::SameTypeTransform<Epetra_LinearProblem>

<li> EpetraExt::CrsGraph_Overlap: Forms the overlapped version of a distributed graph
     up to the user specified level.

<li> Reindexer's: Used to remap the global indexing of an existing Epetra object include
     EpetraExt::CrsMatrix_Reindex, EpetraExt::MultiVector_Reindex, and EpetraExt::LinearProblem_Reindex.

<li> EpetraExt::LinearProblem_Scale: Linear left and right scaling of a Epetra_LinearProblem

<li> Solver Mapping Tools: Remaps the columns of a CrsGraph or LinearProblem to meet the
     requirements of a square local block indexing for some linear solvers. Tools are
     EpetraExt::CrsGraph_SolverMap and EpetraExt::LinearProblem_SolverMap.

<li> EpetraExt::CrsGraph_SymmRCM: Perform a symmetric RCM for the local blocks of a
     Epetra_CrsGraph.

<li> Transpose: Form the explicit transpose of a Epetra_CrsGraph or Epetra_CrsMatrix.
     Tools are EpetraExt::CrsGraph_Transpose and EpetraExt::RowMatrix_Transpose.

<li> View: For sub-block views of existing Epetra objects including EpetraExt::CrsGraph_View,
     EpetraExt::CrsMatrix_View and EpetraExt::MultiVector_View

</ol>

<li> InOut: I/O operations for Epetra objects based on the Matrix Market format.

<li> Coloring: Helper tools for generating Finite Differencing Colorings of Linear Problems.

<li> Zoltan Tools: Primarily tools for generation of repartitioned Epetra objects using
     the Zoltan library.
     
<li> Matlab: Communication interface between Epetra and Matlab.  Exports Epetra objects to Matlab and imports objects from Matlab.
     Sends user specified Matlab commands to the Matlab engine to modify the Matlab workspace which provides user interaction with the Matlab engine.

</ul>
