\class Segment_Linear1D

\brief <b> A class to define a 2-noded linear 1D Segment</b>

This class defines a 2-noded linear 1D interface surface segment.

<b>Important:</b><br>
Upon construction, the user must assure that the nodes attached to this segment are
given in counter-clockwise order:<br>
<pre>


      <--|       o Node 1
  domain |       | 
       --        | --> outward normal n to Seg 2
                 | 
                 | Seg 2
       Seg 1     |
    o------------o Node 0
   Node 0 |  Node 1
          | 
          | outward normal n to Seg 1
          | 
          v

</pre>
The reason for this is that the outward normal to the interface is implicitly defined by
the orientation of the segments. There is no way for the MOERTEL package to check the
orientation of the segments as they are passed in by the user and most obscure results
will be produced when the orientation is uncorrect!

The \ref MOERTEL::Segment_Linear1D class supports the ostream& operator <<
