NOX Documentation
-----------------

You may access/create the NOX documentation in three ways...

1. ONLINE DOCUMENTATION

   The documentation is online at http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/nox.

2. MANUALLY GENERATE THE DOCUMENTATION

   Within the doc subdirectory, type

   > doxygen Doxyfile.default

   Then browse to doc/html/index.html to get started.

   Note that graphical dependency trees will not be generated with this option,
   since doxygen requires the "dot" library out of the graphviz
   package to build the graphics.  By using option 3 below, the
   configure script will check for the dot library and build the extra
   documentation.

3. AUTOMATICALLY GENERATE THE DOCUMENTATION

   Let $NOX_SRC denote the top level NOX directory, and let $NOX_BUILD
   denote the top level build directory (often these are the same).

   Within the $NOX_BUILD directory, type

   > configure [options]
   > make dox

   This will create the documentation inside the $NOX_SRC
   directory. Browse to $NOX_SRC/doc/html/index.html.
