In Step 1 of this tutorial we will:

Starting with this code, all it does now is project ‘1’ onto the basis which yields ‘1’. Please modify this example to be a (positive definite) Helmholtz example. With a source term that is equal to sin(2pi*x)*sin(2pi*y). This can be done in two steps.

1. Add the (grad u, grad v) term to the equation set

2. Implement the sin(2pi*x)*sin(2pi*y) evaluator
