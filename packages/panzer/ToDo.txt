1. The following evaluators do not have adequate test coverage:

Panzer_Integrator_TransientBasisTimesScalar.hpp
Panzer_Neumann_Residual.hpp
Panzer_ReorderADValues_Evaluator.hpp

2. 2016.07.26: The rebalance capability is not supported in new
STK. So in the transition from STK classic, two tests had to have
their rebalance testing disabled:

Trilinos/packages/panzer/adapters-stk/example/main_driver/energy-ss.xml
Trilinos/packages/panzer/adapters-stk/example/main_driver/energy-ss-loca-eigenvalue.xml

When we get rebalance back, we need to reenable the option on these tests.
