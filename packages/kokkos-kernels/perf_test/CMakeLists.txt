# At some point, we may wish to make this into real "performance
# tests," in the sense that they can pass or fail.  At that point, use
# "CATEGORIES PERFORMANCE" to mark them as such.  For now, we just
# build the executables for manual use, but don't run the tests.  They
# build correctly with or without MPI, but only run them with a single
# MPI process.
