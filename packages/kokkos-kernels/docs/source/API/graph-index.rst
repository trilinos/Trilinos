Graph
=====

These algorithms provide generic graph coloring capabilities used by Gauss-Seidel, multigrid aggregation, etc... We distinguish to main categories of algorithms, distance 1 coloring and distance 2 coloring. We also provide a coloring handle that allows users to easily control the behavior of the algorithms.

Graph coloring handle
=====================

The graph coloring handle is extending the KokkosKernels handle to provide options that are specific to coloring algorithms.

Distance 1 graph coloring
=========================

Distance 1 coloring algorithms will ensure that each node has a different color than all of its neighbors.

Distance 2 and One-sided Bipartite graph coloring
=================================================

Distance 2 coloring algorithms will ensure that each node has a different color than its neighbors and its neighbors' neighbors.
