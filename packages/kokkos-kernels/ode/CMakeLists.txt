# Adding unit-tests
# Note BMK: Since ODE has no auto-generated ETI files, this directory does not exist in a build without unit tests.
# This causes configure errors when building an app against a Trilinos install, and the unit test build dir doesn't contain any headers that need to be found.
# But uncomment the next line if ETI headers are ever added.
