How to build the Tutorial
-------------------------

1) Compile MueLu with the tests and examples enabled. You should find the
   executables in the packages/muelu/doc/Tutorial/src subfolder of the build
   folder of Trilinos.

2) Switch to the packages/muelu/doc/Tutorial/tex subfolder of your Trilinos
   build folder.

3) Run the command

     ./prepareTexTutorial.py

   This python scripts runs the examples using the executables built in step 1
   of this tutorial, parses the screen output and includes the results and
   code-snippets into the LaTeX document. This way, the MueLu tutorial always
   contains the latest numbers/results. 

   The screen output of the python script should look like the following:

      Prepare files... 
      Split source files in src folder for inclusion in pdf... 
      Run test examples to include results in pdf... 
      s1_easy.txt OK
      s1_easy_10levels OK
      s1_easy_3levels_unsmoothed OK
      s1_easy_3levels_smoothed OK
      s1_easy_jacobi OK
      s1_easy_jacobi2 OK
      s1_easy_exercise OK
      s2_adv_b OK
      s2_adv_c OK
      s3a OK
      s3b OK
      s3b1 OK
      s3b2 OK
      s3b3 OK
      s5a OK
      s5a.txt OK
      Run LaTeX to generate PDF... 
      If the script stops here you can skip the step by pressing CTRL+C and run
      "pdflatex main.tex" by hand to fix the errors 
      Success
      Clean up files... 
      Finished. 

   Note, that running the script might take a while (especially the LaTeX call
   in the end).

4) It might be necessary to run the latex process one or two times more to
   resolve all references. Use the command

     pdflatex main.tex

   You need a rather new LaTeX version which understands Tikz commands.

5) If successful you should have a main.pdf which has the most recent version
   of the MueLu tutorial.
