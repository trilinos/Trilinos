MueLu's documentation can be built in either the source or build directories:

1) SOURCE DIRECTORY

   You do not need to run cmake.  In the *source* tree, simply do the following
   in the directory muelu/doc:

    a) setenv TRILINOS_HOME /absolute/path/to/your/Trilinos/source/dir
    b) doxygen Doxyfile

2) BUILD DIRECTORY

   a) setenv TRILINOS_HOME /absolute/path/to/your/Trilinos/source/dir
   b) Run your cmake configure line or script.
   c) In the *build* directory in the subdirectory muelu/doc,
      type "make doc".  The documentation will be placed in muelu/doc/html.


NOTE
----
Doxyfile.in is for cmake, Doxyfile is if you want to build the docs
in the source tree.  Both of these files include the same file, "Doxyfile.options".
