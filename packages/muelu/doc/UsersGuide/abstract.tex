%This is the definitive user guide for the \muelu{} library in Trilinos version XX.YY.
%\muelu{} is a C++ multigrid framework that can work with either the \epetra or \tpetra linear
%algebra libraries.
%\muelu{} provides a variety of aggregation-based multigrid algorithms,
%including smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid (AMG), Petrov-Galerkin AMG, and AMG for
%Maxwell's equations, as well as many different types of smoothers.
%\muelu{} is templated on the index, scalar, and compute node types.
%Thus it is possible to use \muelu{} on problems with scalar types other than double, on very
%large problems, and to exploit node-level parallelism.

This is the official user guide for the \muelu{} multigrid library in Trilinos VOTD,
\monthWord, \the\year. This guide provides an overview of \muelu, its capabilities, and
instructions for new users who want to start using \muelu{} with a minimum of
effort. Detailed information is given on how to drive \muelu{} through its XML
interface. Links to more advanced use cases are given. This guide gives
information on how to achieve good parallel performance, as well as how to
introduce new algorithms. Finally, readers will find a comprehensive listing of
available \muelu{} options.  {\em Any options not documented in this manual
should be considered strictly experimental.}
