    @brief Add leftovers to existing aggregates
    @ingroup Aggregation

    ### Idea ###
    In phase 2b non-aggregated nodes are added to existing aggregates.
    All neighbors of the unaggregated node are checked and the corresponding
    aggregate weight is increased. The unaggregated node is added to the aggregate
    with the best weight. A simple penalty strategy makes sure that the non-aggregated
    nodes are added to different aggregates.
    The routine runs twice to cover non-aggregate nodes which have a node distance
    of two to existing aggregates. Assuming that the node distance is not greater
    than 3 (the aggregate diameter size), running the algorithm only twice should
    be sufficient.

    ### Comments ###
    Only nodes with state READY are changed to AGGREGATED. There are no aggregation criteria considered. Especially the aggregation: max agg size criterion is ignored.
    This is not a problem, since after the previous aggregation phases one should not be able to build too large aggregates.
