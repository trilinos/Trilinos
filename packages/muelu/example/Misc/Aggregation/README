Visualization of MueLu aggregates

The example program visualizeAggregates.cpp demonstrates how to visualize aggregates
in MueLu using the plotaggs.py python script.

Usage:
1) run MueLu_VisualizeAggregates.exe
mpirun -np 4 ./MueLu_VisualizeAggregates.exe

In MueLu_VisualizeAggregats we use MueLu for generating an AMG hierarchy for a simple
convection diffusion problem (windvector=[1,0]) on a unit square domain with homogenous
Dirichlet boundaries. The matrix (and rhs) has been generated by BACI using linear finite
elements.
We keep the aggregates on all levels by setting
Finest->Keep("Aggregates",UCAggFact.get());
In the end we call the ExportAggregates function for every level. Then all processors
write out their aggregates in the aggs_levelX_procY.out file.

2) For visualizing the aggregates we need the coordinates of the fine level nodes.
The user has to provide them in a file called "nodes0.txt". The format is very simple
(look at the example file). Of course you can also change the read_nodes(filename) routine
in plotaggs for your own fileformat.

3) adapt main routine in plotaggs.py (line 281)
You have to change A and B in
plot_aggregates(A,B)
where A is the number levels that shall be plotted (should be smaller than the maximum levels :-) )
and B is the number of procs you used in your mpirun commmand (should be smaller or equal to 4, i did
only define colors for max 4 procs).

4) make sure that all files aggs_levelX_procY.out, convhull.py (that is used for calculating the convex
hulls for the aggregates) and nodes0.txt are in the same folder as plotaggs.py. Then just call
./plotaggs.py

If you have installed all necessary python packages you should get a plot of your aggregates.

Note: you need the "numpy" and "matplotlib" python packages. Both are usually not installed per default
but can be easily installed using the package manager of your linux distri.

Drawbacks:
- usage not very comfortable
- works only for 2d
