The tests in this directory compare the output of several MueLu runs
with reference log files ("gold files"). This means that when the
output changes, because a parameter was added, some of these test will
fail. In order to update the gold files to account for the changes:

1) Run the tests.
2) In your $BUILD_DIR/packages/muelu/test/interface run "make rebase"
3) Reconfigure and run tests again to check that everything passes
   now.

This needs to be repeated for different combinations of
instantiations. Currently, there are 4 sets of gold files:

1) kokkos + scalar==complex
2) kokkos + scalar!=complex
3) no kokkos + scalar==complex
3) no kokkos + scalar!=complex
