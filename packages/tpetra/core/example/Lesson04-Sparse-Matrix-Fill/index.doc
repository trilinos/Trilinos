\brief Different ways to add entries to Tpetra sparse matrix

\section Tpetra_Lesson04_Topics Lesson topics

This lesson explains how to add entries to a Tpetra sparse matrix
(Tpetra::CrsMatrix).  It explains how you can choose any of various
ways to add entries to the matrix.  Some are more flexible but less
efficient, and others are more efficient but less flexible.  In
general, knowing the sparse matrix structure in advance will reduce
both peak memory usage and total run time.

This lesson does not currently include code examples.  The section
\ref Tpetra_Lesson04_Exercise at the end suggests modifying the
example \ref Tpetra_Lesson03 in order to learn about the different
ways to add or change the entries of a sparse matrix.

\section Tpetra_Lesson04_Fill Filling a sparse matrix

We call adding entries to a sparse matrix <i>filling</i> it, and call
the general procedure "sparse matrix fill" or just <i>fill</i>.  Often
people have finite element assembly in mind when they use this
expression, but fill here means adding entries for any reason.  For
example, you might want to
<ul>
<li> solve an optimization problem with a set of linear constraints,
so you would add one row to the sparse matrix for each constraint; or
</li>
<li> represent a weighted graph as a sparse matrix, so that each row
of the matrix represents a vertex's adjacency list and corresponding
edge weights. </li>
</ul>
Also, by extension, "fill" might refer to modifying existing entries
of a sparse matrix.

\section Tpetra_Lesson04_Rowwise Rowwise access, not rowwise distribution

CrsMatrix inherits from the RowMatrix interface; it "is a" RowMatrix.
Some people have the misconception that "RowMatrix" (and therefore
CrsMatrix) refers to a rowwise distribution of the sparse matrix over
parallel processes.  It does not.  CrsMatrix supports an arbitrary
"two-dimensional" distribution of rows and columns over processes.
The term instead refers to rowwise access to the data.  That is, the
methods in this interface and in CrsMatrix let you add or access
entries on each process by row.

This distinction matters because two or more processes might share
entries in a row.  Asking for "all the entries in a row" on a
particular process only accesses the entries owned by that process,
which is not necessarily all the entries in a row.

Whether adding entries or modifying existing ones, you may always do
so for any number of entries in the row, such that their columns are
owned by the calling process.  You should always modify as many
entries with one method call as possible, in order to amortize
function call and data access overhead.

\section Tpetra_Lesson04_Phases Phases of fill

A sparse matrix may be in any of three different states:
<ol>
<li> Post construction, before first call to \c fillComplete() </li>
<li> \c fillComplete() has been called after construction or \c resumeFill() </li>
<li> \c resumeFill() has been called </li>
</ol>

In States 1 and 3, you are allowed to set or modify values in the
matrix.  If the matrix was not created with a constant graph (see
below), and if there is room in the row (see "static profile"
discussion below), you are allowed to insert entries into the matrix.

We call a matrix in State 2 "fill complete."  In State 2, you are
<i>not</i> allowed to modify the matrix <i>at all</i>.  (This is
different than Epetra_CrsMatrix, which allows modifications to the
values (but not the structure) of a fill complete matrix.)

Calling \c fillComplete() does a lot of work.  In general, it requires
distributed-memory communication as well as local rearrangement of
data.  The intent is that you should exploit this work for as long as
possible before calling \c resumeFill().  You can do so by performing
multiple sparse matrix-vector multiplies or triangular solves.

\section Tpetra_Lesson04_Tradeoffs Trade-offs between flexibility and performance

In all the examples below, we assume the following "preamble" of code:
\code
using Teuchos::RCP;
using Teuchos::rcp;
// Your scalar type; the type of sparse matrix entries. e.g., double.
typedef ST ...; 
// Your local ordinal type; the signed integer type 
// used to store local sparse matrix indices.  e.g., int.
typedef LO ...; 
// Your global ordinal type; the signed integer type 
// used to index the matrix globally, over all processes.
// e.g., int, long, ptrdif_t, int64_t, ...
typedef GO ...; 
// The Node type.  e.g., Kokkos::DefaultNode::DefaultNodeType, 
// defined in Kokkos_DefaultNode.hpp.
typedef NT ...; 
\endcode


\section Tpetra_Lesson04_Tradeoffs_dyn_hint Allocation with a size hint

CrsMatrix lets you make trade-offs between flexibility and
performance.  All of these trade-offs revolve around how much you know
about the structure of the sparse matrix -- that is, its graph -- in
advance.  In the most general case, all you know is which process owns
which row -- the row Map.
\code
RCP<const Map<LO, GO, NT> > rowMap = ...; // whatever row Map you want
RCP<CrsMatrix<ST, LO, GO, NT> > A = rcp (new CrsMatrix<ST, LO, GO, NT> (rowMap ,sizehint));
\endcode
This code snippet says that you want to create a sparse matrix with
the given row distribution with a certain approximate number of entries per row.  
It also says that you intend each process
to own all the entries in a given row.  If you want to allow a more
general "2-D" distribution, you must also tell the constructor which
process owns which columns of the matrix.  You do so by supplying a
"column Map":
\code
RCP<const Map<LO, GO, NT> > rowMap = ...; // whatever row Map you want
RCP<const Map<LO, GO, NT> > colMap = ...; // whatever column Map you want
RCP<CrsMatrix<ST, LO, GO, NT> > A = rcp (new CrsMatrix<ST, LO, GO, NT> (rowMap, colMap, sizehint));
\endcode
All the examples that follow allow you to supply a column Map if you
which, so we omit this for brevity.


CrsMatrix lets you make trade-offs between flexibility and
performance.  All of these trade-offs revolve around how much you know
about the structure of the sparse matrix -- that is, its graph -- in
advance.  In the most general case, all you know is which process owns
which row -- the row Map --- and an approximate number of nonzeros per row.
You may do so either
with a single number, which is an expected upper bound on the number
of entries in any one row, or with an upper bound for each row of the
matrix.  The typical use case is a single upper bound, which we
illustrate below.
\code
RCP<const Map<LO, GO, NT> > rowMap = ...; // whatever row Map you want
// With dynamic profile, this is only a hint, not a hard constraint.
const size_t maxEntriesPerRow = 3;
RCP<CrsMatrix<ST, LO, GO, NT> > A = 
  rcp (new CrsMatrix<ST, LO, GO, NT> (rowMap, maxEntriesPerRow));
\endcode
Giving an upper bound on the number of entries per row allows the
matrix to preallocate space for each row, which is especially critical on architectures where
memory allocation is relatively expensive (e.g. GPUs).


\section Tpetra_Lesson04_Tradeoffs_const_graph Constant graph

The most efficient but least flexible fill method is to create the
CrsMatrix with a constant graph.  That is, you create a CrsGraph
separately, fill it, call its \c fillComplete() method, then pass the
graph to the CrsMatrix constructor.  This completely constrains the
structure of the CrsMatrix.  You may only set or modify values in the
matrix, not the structure.  (This means you may not call \c
insertGlobalValues() or \c insertLocalValues(), only the
<tt>replace*Values()</tt>, <tt>sumInto*Values</tt>, \c scale(), and
<tt>setAllToScalar()</tt> methods.

\code
using Tpetra::CrsGraph;

// Note that the CrsMatrix constructor takes a "const" graph,
// meaning that the CrsMatrix is not allowed to change the
// graph.  You shouldn't either.  This is why we use an
// RCP<const CrsGraph> ("pointer to const graph") below.
// The graph must be fill complete.
RCP<const CrsGraph<LO, GO, NT> > graph = ...; 

// The graph comes with the row and column Maps already built in.
RCP<CrsMatrix<ST, LO, GO, NT> > A = rcp (new CrsMatrix<ST, LO, GO, NT> (graph));
\endcode
Filling the CrsGraph works much like filling a CrsMatrix, except that
you only specify structure, not values.  Furthermore, the same size
hint and dynamic profile vs. static profile options apply to CrsGraph.

\section Tpetra_Lesson04_local_vs_global Local vs. global indices

Please see \ref Tpetra_Lesson02 for a detailed explanation of global
and local indices.

In the sparse matrix's final state, it represents column indices as
local indices.  This is faster for operations like sparse
matrix-vector multiply.  It saves storage as well, especially if
<tt>sizeof(LocalOrdinal) < sizeof(GlobalOrdinal)</tt>.  However,
accessing or inserting entries by local index is only allowed under
certain conditions.  In particular, the matrix must have a column Map,
which tells it how to convert between global and local indices for the
column indices of the matrix.  If you didn't create the matrix with a
precomputed column Map (either in its constructor, or in the constant
graph), it has to compute the column Map on its own.  It does so in
\c fillComplete().

If the matrix doesn't have a column Map yet, you must use global
indices, since local indices don't exist yet.  However, if you can use
local indices, you should.  For global indices, the matrix must go to
the Map to look up the corresponding local index for every global
index.  Local indices only require an array access.

Remember that if column indices are local, then they are counted with
respect to the column Map.  Local row and column indices may not
necessarily be the same.  For example, the matrix entry at position
<tt>(i_local, i_local)</tt>, where the first \c i_local is the local
row index and the second \c i_local the local column index, may not
necessarily be a diagonal entry of the matrix.  However, the matrix
entry at global position <tt>(i_global, i_global)</tt> is always a
diagonal entry of the matrix.

\section Tpetra_Lesson04_Exercise Exercise

Start with the \ref Tpetra_Lesson03 example, which uses
global indices.  Try all of the different fill techniques
described in this lesson.  If you like, you may also try cyclic
boundary conditions instead of Dirichlet boundary conditions in the
1-D Poisson discretization.  (This makes the number of entries per row
the same for all rows.)
