Introduction
============

This is a collection of example problems Tpetra.  It contains several examples that illustrate the use of Tpetra for common scenarios. Some of the examples require combinations of the capabilities in Tpetra.

The examples have been chosen to serve two purposes: to verify the capabilities in Tpetra by exercising the code on nontrivial cases and to provide guidance to users. In each worked example the discussion in the guide states why the example is included and leads the reader through the approach taken.
