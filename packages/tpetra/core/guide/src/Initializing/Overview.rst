Overview
========

MPI (or non-MPI) initialization is required in order to use Tpetra. The
initialization procedure differs slightly, depending on whether you are writing
a code from scratch, or introducing Tpetra into an existing code base.
Examples for initializing Tpetra for different use cases are provided.
