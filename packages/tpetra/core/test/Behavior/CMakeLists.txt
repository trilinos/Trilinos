# Note: The tests for the Behavior class are scattered across several files,
# rather than being confined to a single file.  The reason is that the Behavior
# class is instantiated one time only and once environment variables are read,
# they are cached for future use.  Therefore, to test several values of an
# environment variable, several tests need to be created (one for each distinct
# value of the environment variable).
