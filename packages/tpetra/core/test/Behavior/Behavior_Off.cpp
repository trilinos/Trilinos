 * Note: The tests for the Behavior class are scattered across several files,

 * class is instantiated one time only and once environment variables are read,
 * they are cached for future use.  Therefore, to test several values of an
 * environment variable, several tests need to be created (one for each distinct
 * value of the environment variable).
