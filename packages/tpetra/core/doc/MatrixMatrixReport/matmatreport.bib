abstract = "The Trilinos Project is an effort to facilitate the design, development, integration and ongoing support of mathematical software libraries within an object-oriented framework for the solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and scienti c problems. Trilinos addresses two fundamental issues of developing software for these problems: (i) Providing a streamlined process and set of tools for development of new algorithmic implementations and (ii) promoting interoperability of independently developed software.
\par Trilinos uses a two-level software structure designed around collections of packages. A Trilinos package is an integral unit usually developed by a small team of experts in a particular algorithms area such as algebraic preconditioners, nonlinear solvers, etc. Packages exist underneath the Trilinos top level, which provides a common look-and-feel, including configuration, documentation, licensing, and bug-tracking.
\par Here we present the overall Trilinos design, describing our use of abstract interfaces and default concrete implementations. We discuss the services that Trilinos provides to a prospective package and how these services are used by various packages. We also illustrate how packages can be combined to rapidly develop new algorithms. Finally, we discuss how Trilinos facilitates highquality software engineering practices that are increasingly required from simulation software."}

  abstract = {Design Patterns Explained: A New Perspective on Object-Oriented
             Design draws together the principles of object-oriented
             programming with the power of design patterns to create an
             environment for robust and reliable software development. Packed
             with practical and applicable examples, this book teaches you to
             solve common programming problems with patterns--and explains the
             advantages of patterns for modern software design. Beginning with
             a complete overview of the fundamentals of patterns, Design
             Patterns Explained stresses the importance of analysis and
             design. The authors clearly demonstrate how patterns can
             facilitate the overall development process. Throughout the book,
             key object-oriented design principles are explained, along with
             the concepts and benefits behind specific patterns. With
             illustrative examples in C++ and Java, the book demystifies the
             ``whys," ``why nots," and ``hows" of patterns and explains
             pattern implementation.},
