/// This class provides an abstract interface to a way for Directory
/// to "break ties" in ownership of global indices.  To "break a
/// tie" for a global index GID means: Given a set of one or more
/// (PID, LID) pairs, where each PID is a process that owns GID and
/// LID is the corresponding local index of GID, choose exactly one
/// (PID, LID) pair from that set.  Furthermore, this choice must be
/// a <i>global</i> choice, that is, the same on all participating
/// processes.

  /// (PID), and its local index (LID) on that process.
  ///
  /// FIXME (mfh 15 Sep 2013) This should be an implementation
  /// detail of subclasses; there should be no need to expose it in
  /// the public interface.
  ///
  /// FIXME (mfh 15 Sep 2013) PID should go last, so this struct
  /// would pack into 128 bits if <tt>LocalOrdinal</tt> is 32 bits
  /// and <tt>GlobalOrdinal</tt> is 64 bits.  I would fix the order

  /// of this class, and if you know that your implementation of
  /// selectedIndex() does <i>not</i> have side effects, then you
  /// may redefine this method to return false.  This may skip using
  /// the TieBreak object in certain cases, to save local work.

  ///
  /// Given a global index GID, and a set of (PID, LID) pairs (of
  /// processes that own GID, and the local index of GID on that
  /// process), return the index of one pair in the list.
  ///
  /// This method must always be called collectively over all the
  /// processes in the Directory's communicator.  Subclasses reserve
  /// the right to use communication (either point-to-point or
  /// collective) over that communicator, but are not required to do
  /// so.  However, their decisions are required to be
  /// <i>consistent</i> over those processes.  This means that if
  /// multiple processes call this method with the same GID and the
  /// same list of pairs, all these processes must return the same
  /// index.  (It would also be a good idea for subclasses not to be
  /// sensitive to the order of pairs.)
