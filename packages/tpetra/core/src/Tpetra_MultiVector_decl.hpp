  ///
  /// A "multivector" contains one or more dense vectors.  All the
  /// vectors in a multivector have the same distribution of rows in
  /// parallel over the communicator used to create the multivector.
  /// Multivectors containing more than one vector are useful for
  /// algorithms that solve multiple linear systems at once, or that
  /// solve for a cluster of eigenvalues and their corresponding
  /// eigenvectors at once.  These "block" algorithms often have
  /// accuracy or performance advantages over corresponding algorithms
  /// that solve for only one vector at a time.  For example, working
  /// with multiple vectors at a time allows Tpetra to use faster BLAS
  /// 3 routines for local computations.  It may also reduce the
  /// number of parallel reductions.
  ///
  /// The Vector class implements the MultiVector interface, so if you
  /// only wish to work with a single vector at a time, you may simply
  /// use Vector instead of MultiVector.  However, if you are writing
  /// solvers or preconditioners, you would do better to write to the
  /// MultiVector interface and always assume that each MultiVector
  /// contains more than one vector.  This will make your solver or
  /// preconditioner more compatible with other Trilinos packages, and
  /// it will also let you exploit the performance optimizations
  /// mentioned above.

  /// \section Kokkos_KR_MV_prereq Prerequisites
  ///
  /// Before reading the rest of this documentation, it helps to know
  /// a little bit about Kokkos.  In particular, you should know about
  /// execution spaces, memory spaces, and shallow copy semantics.
  /// You should also know something about the Teuchos memory
  /// management classes, in particular Teuchos::RCP, though it helps
  /// to know a bit about Teuchos::ArrayRCP and Teuchos::ArrayView as
  /// well.  You may also want to know about the differences between
  /// BLAS 1, 2, and 3 operations, and learn a little bit about MPI
  /// (the Message Passing Interface for distributed-memory
  /// programming).  You won't have to use MPI directly to use
  /// MultiVector, but it helps to be familiar with the general idea
  /// of distributed storage of data over a communicator.
  ///
  /// \section Kokkos_KR_MV_view A MultiVector is a view of data
  ///
  /// A MultiVector is a view of data.  A <i>view</i> behaves like a
  /// pointer; it provides access to the original multivector's data
  /// without copying the data.  This means that the copy constructor
  /// and assignment operator (<tt>operator=</tt>) do <i>shallow</i>
  /// copies.  They do <i>not</i> copy the data; they just copy
  /// pointers and other "metadata."  If you would like to copy a
  /// MultiVector into an existing MultiVector, call the nonmember
  /// function deep_copy().  If you would like to create a new
  /// MultiVector which is a deep copy of an existing MultiVector,
  /// call the nonmember function createCopy(), or use the
  /// two-argument copy constructor with Teuchos::Copy as the second
  /// argument.
  ///
  /// Views have the additional property that they automatically
  /// handle deallocation.  They use <i>reference counting</i> for
  /// this, much like how std::shared_ptr works.  That means you do
  /// not have to worry about "freeing" a MultiVector after it has
  /// been created.  Furthermore, you may pass shallow copies around
  /// without needing to worry about which is the "master" view of the
  /// data.  There is no "master" view of the data; when the last view
  /// falls out of scope, the data will be deallocated.
  ///
  /// This is what the documentation means when it speaks of <i>view
  /// semantics</i>.  The opposite of that is <i>copy</i> or
  /// <i>container</i> semantics, where the copy constructor and
  /// <tt>operator=</tt> do deep copies (of the data).  We say that
  /// "std::vector has container semantics," and "MultiVector has view
  /// semantics."
  ///
  /// MultiVector also has "subview" methods that give results
  /// analogous to the Kokkos::subview() function.  That is, they
  /// return a MultiVector which views some subset of another
  /// MultiVector's rows and columns.  The subset of columns in a view
  /// need not be contiguous.  For example, given a multivector X with
  /// 43 columns, it is possible to have a multivector Y which is a
  /// view of columns 1, 3, and 42 (zero-based indices) of X.  We call
  /// such multivectors <i>noncontiguous</i>.  They have the the
  /// property that isConstantStride() returns false.
  ///
  /// Noncontiguous multivectors lose some performance advantages.
  /// For example, local computations may be slower, since Tpetra
  /// cannot use BLAS 3 routines (e.g., matrix-matrix multiply) on a
  /// noncontiguous multivectors without copying into temporary
  /// contiguous storage.  For performance reasons, if you get a
  /// Kokkos::View of a noncontiguous MultiVector's local data, it
  /// does <i>not</i> correspond to the columns that the MultiVector
  /// views.
  ///
  /// \section Kokkos_KR_MV_dual DualView semantics
  ///
  /// Tpetra was designed to perform well on many different kinds of
  /// computers.  Some computers have different <i>memory spaces</i>.
  /// For example, GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) by NVIDIA have
  /// "device memory" and "host memory."  The GPU has faster access to
  /// device memory than host memory, but usually there is less device
  /// memory than host memory.  Intel's "Knights Landing" architecture
  /// has two different memory spaces, also with different capacity
  /// and performance characteristics.  Some architectures let the
  /// processor address memory in any space, possibly with a
  /// performance penalty.  Others can only access data in certain
  /// spaces, and require a special system call to copy memory between
  /// spaces.
  ///
  /// The Kokkos package provides abstractions for handling multiple
  /// memory spaces.  In particular, Kokkos::DualView lets users
  /// "mirror" data that live in one space, with data in another
  /// space.  It also lets users manually mark data in one space as
  /// modified (modify()), and synchronize (sync()) data from one
  /// space to another.  The latter only actually copies if the data
  /// have been marked as modified.  Users can access data in a
  /// particular space by calling view().  All three of these methods
  /// -- modify(), sync(), and view() -- are templated on the memory
  /// space.  This is how users select the memory space on which they
  /// want the method to act.
  ///
  /// MultiVector implements "DualView semantics."  This means that it
  /// implements the above three operations:
  /// <ul>
  /// <li> modify(): Mark data in a memory space as modified (or about
  ///      to be modified) </li>
  /// <li> sync(): If data in the target memory space are least
  ///      recently modified compared with the other space, copy data
  ///      to the target memory space </li>
  /// <li> getLocalView(): Return a Kokkos::View of the data in a
  ///      given memory space </li>
  /// </ul>
  ///
  /// If your computer only has one memory space, as with conventional
  /// single-core or multicore processors, you don't have to worry
  /// about this.  You can ignore the modify() and sync() methods in
  /// that case.
  ///
  /// \section Kokkos_KR_MV_access How to access the local data
  ///
  /// The getLocalView() method for getting a Kokkos::View is the main
  /// way to access a MultiVector's local data.  If you want to read
  /// or write the actual values in a multivector, this is what you
  /// want.  The resulting Kokkos::View behaves like a 2-D array.  You
  /// can address it using an index pair (i,j), where i is the local
  /// row index, and j is the column index.
  ///
  /// MultiVector also has methods that return an
  /// Teuchos::ArrayRCP<Scalar> ("1-D view"), or a
  /// Teuchos::ArrayRCP<Teuchos::ArrayRCP<Scalar> > ("2-D view").
  /// These exist only for backwards compatibility, and also give
  /// access to the local data.
  ///
  /// All of these views only view <i>local</i> data.  This means that
  /// the corresponding rows of the multivector are owned by the
  /// calling (MPI) process.  You may <i>not</i> use these methods to
  /// access <i>remote</i> data, that is, rows that do not belong to
  /// the calling process.
  ///
  /// MultiVector's public interface also has methods for modifying
  /// local data, like sumIntoLocalValue() and replaceGlobalValue().
  /// These methods act on host data <i>only</i>.  To access or modify
  /// device data, you must get the Kokkos::View and work with it
  /// directly.
  ///
  /// \section Kokkos_KR_MV_why Why won't you give me a raw pointer?
  ///
  /// Tpetra was designed to allow different data representations
  /// underneath the same interface.  This lets Tpetra run correctly
  /// and efficiently on many different kinds of hardware.  These
  /// different kinds of hardware all have in common the following:
  /// <ul>
  /// <li> Data layout matters a lot for performance </li>
  /// <li> The right layout for your data depends on the hardware </li>
  /// <li> Data may be distributed over different memory spaces in
  ///      hardware, and efficient code must respect this, whether or
  ///      not the programming model presents the different memories
  ///      as a single address space </li>
  /// <li> Copying between different data layouts or memory spaces is
  ///      expensive and should be avoided whenever possible </li>
  /// <li> Optimal data layout may require control over initialization
  ///      of storage </li>
  /// </ul>
  /// These conclusions have practical consequences for the
  /// MultiVector interface.  In particular, we have deliberately made
  /// it difficult for you to access data directly by raw pointer.
  /// This is because the underlying layout may not be what you
  /// expect.  The memory might not even be accessible from the host
  /// CPU.  Instead, we give access through a Kokkos::View, which
  /// behaves like a 2-D array.  You can ask the Kokkos::View for a
  /// raw pointer by calling its <tt>data()</tt> method, but
  /// then you are responsible for understanding its layout in memory.
  ///
  /// \section Kokkos_KR_MV_dist Parallel distribution of data
  ///
  /// A MultiVector's rows are distributed over processes in its (row)
  /// Map's communicator.  A MultiVector is a DistObject; the Map of
  /// the DistObject tells which process in the communicator owns
  /// which rows.  This means that you may use Import and Export
  /// operations to migrate between different distributions.  Please
  /// refer to the documentation of Map, Import, and Export for more
  /// information.
  ///
  /// MultiVector includes methods that perform parallel all-reduces.
  /// These include inner products and various kinds of norms.  All of
  /// these methods have the same blocking semantics as
  /// <tt>MPI_Allreduce</tt>.
  ///
  /// \warning Some computational methods, such as inner products and
  ///   norms, may return incorrect results if the MultiVector's Map
  ///   is overlapping (not one-to-one) but not locally replicated.
  ///   That is, if some but not all rows are shared by more than one
  ///   process in the communicator, then inner products and norms may
  ///   be wrong.  This behavior may change in future releases.

    /// A: Suppose that for the MultiVector's device type, there are
    /// actually two memory spaces (e.g., for Kokkos::Cuda with UVM
    /// off, assuming that this is allowed).  In order for MultiVector
    /// to implement DualView semantics correctly, this constructor
    /// must allocate a Kokkos::View of host memory (or lazily
    /// allocate it on modify() or sync()).
    ///
    /// Now suppose that you pass in the same Kokkos::View of device
    /// memory to two different MultiVector instances, X and Y.  Each
    /// would allocate its own Kokkos::View of host memory.  That
    /// means that X and Y would have different DualView instances,
    /// but their DualView instances would have the same device View.
    ///
    /// Suppose that you do the following:
    /// <ol>
    /// <li> Modify X on host (calling modify() correctly) </li>
    /// <li> Modify Y on host (calling modify() correctly) </li>
    /// <li> Sync Y to device (calling sync() correctly) </li>
    /// <li> Sync X to device (calling sync() correctly) </li>

    /// This would clobber Y's later changes on host, in favor of X's
    /// earlier changes on host.  That could be very confusing.  We
    /// allow this behavior because Kokkos::DualView allows it.  That
    /// is, Kokkos::DualView also lets you get the device View, and
