/// \brief Abstract base class for objects that can be the source of
///   an Import or Export operation.
///
/// Any object that may be the source of an Import or Export data
/// redistribution operation must inherit from this class.  This
/// class implements no methods, other than a trivial virtual
/// destructor.  If a subclass X inherits from this class, that
/// indicates that the subclass can be the source of an Import or
/// Export, for <i>some set</i> of subclasses of DistObject.  A
/// subclass Y of DistObject which is the target of the Import or
/// Export operation will attempt to cast the input source
/// SrcDistObject to a subclass which it knows how to treat as a
/// source object.  The target subclass Y is responsible for knowing
/// what source classes to expect, and how to interpret the
/// resulting source object.
///
/// DistObject inherits from this class, since a DistObject subclass
/// may be either the source or the target of an Import or Export.
/// A SrcDistObject subclass which does not inherit from DistObject
/// need only be a valid source of an Import or Export; it need not
/// be a valid target.
///
/// This object compares to the Epetra class Epetra_SrcDistObject.
/// Unlike in Epetra, this class in Tpetra does <tt>not</tt> include
/// a getMap() method.  This is for two reasons.  First, consider
/// the following inheritance hierarchy: DistObject and RowGraph
/// inherit from SrcDistObject, and CrsGraph inherits from
/// DistObject and RowGraph.  If SrcDistObject had a virtual getMap
/// method, that would make resolution of the method ambiguous.
/// Second, it is not necessary for SrcDistObject to have a getMap
/// method, because a SrcDistObject alone does not suffice as the
/// source of an Import or Export.  Any DistObject subclass must
/// cast the SrcDistObject to a subclass which it knows how to treat
/// as the source of an Import or Export.  Thus, it's not necessary
/// for SrcDistObject to have a getMap method, since it needs to be
/// cast anyway before use.  In general, I prefer to keep interfaces
/// as simple as possible.
class SrcDistObject {
 public:
  /// \brief Virtual destructor.

  /// It's necessary to provide this both for memory safety of
  /// derived classes, and to make SrcDistObject a polymorphic type
  /// (otherwise it can't be the argument of a dynamic_cast).
