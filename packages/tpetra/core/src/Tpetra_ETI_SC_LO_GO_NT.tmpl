// WARNING: This file is automatically generated by CMake, and written
// to Trilinos' build (not source) directory.  DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
// If you run CMake again, it will overwrite any changes that you
// made.  Furthermore, it would be unwise to assume anything about
// this file: it may disappear at any time, and its name, location, or
// contents may change at any time.
//
// CMake takes each expression in the original .tmpl file enclosed by
// "at" symbols ("a" with a circle around it), and replaces it in the
// generated .cpp file with a string defined by Tpetra's CMake logic
// (see CMakeLists.txt in this directory).  Thus, the original .tmpl
// file is NOT syntactically correct C++, but the .cpp file generated
// by running CMake on it IS a syntactically correct C++ file.
