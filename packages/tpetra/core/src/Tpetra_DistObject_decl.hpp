  /// \section Tpetra_DistObject_Summary Summary
  ///
  /// Most Tpetra users will only use this class' methods to perform
  /// data redistribution for subclasses such as CrsGraph, CrsMatrix,
  /// MultiVector, and Vector.  DistObject provides four methods for
  /// redistributing data: two versions of <tt>doImport()</tt>, and
  /// two versions of <tt>doExport()</tt>.  Import operations
  /// redistribute data from a nonoverlapping (one-to-one)
  /// distribution to a possibly overlapping distribution.  Export
  /// operations redistribute data from a possibly overlapping
  /// distribution to a nonoverlapping (one-to-one) distribution.
  /// Once you have precomputed a data redistribution plan (an Import
  /// or Export object), you may use the plan to redistribute an input
  /// object's data into this object, by calling one of these methods.
  /// The input object of <tt>doImport()</tt> or <tt>doExport()</tt>
  /// is always the "source" of the redistribution operation, which
  /// sends the data.  The <tt>*this</tt> object is the target, which
  /// receives and combines the data.  It has the distribution given
  /// by <tt>this->getMap()</tt>.
  ///
  /// \section Tpetra_DistObject_FwdRev Forward or reverse redistribution modes
  ///
  /// Both Import and Export operations occur in two modes: forward
  /// and reverse.  Forward mode is the usual case, where you are
  /// calling a method with its matching plan type
  /// (<tt>doImport()</tt> for an Import plan, or <tt>doExport()</tt>
  /// for an Export plan).  In that case, the input DistObject must
  /// have the same Map as the source Map of the plan, and the target
  /// DistObject must have the same Map as the target Map of the plan.
  /// Reverse mode is also possible, where you call a method with the
  /// opposite plan type (<tt>doImport()</tt> for an Export plan, or
  /// <tt>doExport()</tt> for an Import plan).  In that case, the
  /// source DistObject's Map must be the same as the target Map of
  /// the plan, and the target DistObject's Map must be the same as
  /// the source Map of the plan.  If you call <tt>doImport()</tt>, we
  /// still call this an Import operation, even if you are using an
  /// Export plan in reverse.  Similarly, if you call
  /// <tt>doExport()</tt>, we call this an Export operation.
  ///
  /// Most users will want to use forward mode.  However, reverse mode
  /// is useful for some applications.  For example, suppose you are
  /// solving a nonlinear partial differential equation using the
  /// finite element method, with Newton's method for the nonlinear
  /// equation.  When assembling into a vector, it is convenient and
  /// efficient to do local assembly first into a vector with an
  /// overlapping distribution, then do global assembly via forward
  /// mode Export into a vector with a nonoverlapping distribution.
  /// After the linear solve, you may want to bring the resulting
  /// nonoverlapping distribution vector back to the overlapping
  /// distribution for another update phase.  This would be a reverse
  /// mode Import, using the precomputed Export object.
  ///
  /// Another use case for reverse mode is in CrsMatrix, for the
  /// transpose version of distributed sparse matrix-vector multiply
  /// ("mat-vec").  Non-transpose mat-vec (a function from the domain
  /// Map to the range Map) does an Import to bring in the source
  /// vector's data from the domain Map to the column Map of the
  /// sparse matrix, and an Export (if necessary) to bring the results
  /// from the row Map of the sparse matrix to the range Map.
  /// Transpose mat-vec (a function from the range Map to the domain
  /// Map) uses these precomputed Import and Export objects in reverse
  /// mode: first the Export in reverse mode to Import the source
  /// vector's data to the row Map, and then the Import in reverse
  /// mode to Export the results to the domain Map.  Reverse mode lets
  /// us reuse the precomputed data redistribution plans for the
  /// transpose case.
  ///
  /// \section Tpetra_DistObject_ImplSubclass How to implement a subclass
  ///
  /// If you want to implement your own DistObject subclass, you

  /// GitHub Issue #4853) and will be removed soon.  Do not implement
  /// the "old" interface.

  /// an object can be the target of an Import or Export, it can also
