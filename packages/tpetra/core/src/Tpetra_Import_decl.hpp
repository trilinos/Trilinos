  ///   documentation of Map for requirements.

  /// Tpetra users should use this class to construct a communication
  /// plan between two data distributions (i.e., two Map objects).
  /// The plan can be called repeatedly by computational classes to
  /// perform communication according to the same pattern.
  /// Constructing the plan may be expensive, both in terms of
  /// communication and computation.  However, it can be reused
  /// inexpensively.
  ///
  /// Tpetra has two classes for data redistribution: Import and
  /// Export.  Import is for redistributing data from a uniquely-owned
  /// distribution to a possibly multiply-owned distribution.  Export
  /// is for redistributing data from a possibly multiply-owned
  /// distribution to a uniquely-owned distribution.
  ///
  /// The names "Import" and "Export" have nothing to do with the
  /// direction in which data moves relative to the calling process;
  /// any process may do both receives and sends in an Import or
  /// Export.  Rather, the names suggest what happens in their most
  /// common use case, the communication pattern for sparse
  /// matrix-vector multiply.  Import "brings in" remote source vector
  /// data (from the domain Map to the column Map) for local
  /// computation, and Export "pushes" the result back (from the row
  /// Map to the range Map).  Import and Export have other uses as
  /// well.
  ///
  /// As mentioned above, one use case of Import is bringing in remote
  /// source vector data for a distributed sparse matrix-vector
  /// multiply.  The source vector itself is uniquely owned, but must
  /// be brought in into an overlapping distribution so that each
  /// process can compute its part of the target vector without
  /// further communication.
  ///
  /// Epetra separated Import and Export for performance reasons.  The
  /// implementation is different, depending on which direction is the
  /// uniquely-owned Map.  Tpetra retains this convention.
  ///
  /// This class is templated on the same template arguments as Map:
  /// the local ordinal type <tt>LocalOrdinal</tt>, the global ordinal
  /// type <tt>GlobalOrdinal</tt>, and the Kokkos <tt>Node</tt> type.
  ///
  /// This method accepts an optional list of parameters, either
  /// through the constructor or through the setParameterList()
  /// method.  Most users do not need to worry about these parameters;
  /// the default values are fine.  However, for expert users, we
  /// expose the following parameter:
  /// - "Barrier between receives and sends" (\c bool): Whether to
  ///   execute a barrier between receives and sends, when executing
  ///   the Import (i.e., when calling DistObject's doImport()
  ///   (forward mode) or doExport() (reverse mode)).
