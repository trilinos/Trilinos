/// \class Packable
/// \brief Abstract base class for objects that can be the source of
///   an Import or Export operation, and that also know how to pack
///   their data to send to the target object.
/// \tparam Packet The type of each entry of the array of packed
///   data to be sent in the Import or Export operation.  The type
///   of packed data may differ from the type of actual data stored
///   in the object.  For example, a sparse matrix might need to
///   pack both column indices (an integer type) and values
///   (typically, but not always, a floating-point type), and it
///   might choose any of various types to represent packed data.
/// \tparam LocalOrdinal The type of local indices in the object.
///   This is a template parameter because the pack() method
///   includes as input a list of local indices to pack.  See the
///   documentation of Map for requirements.
///
/// If an object implements Packable, then that object acknowledges
/// that it knows how to pack its data as the source object of an
/// Import or Export operation.  The target object in general
/// assumes responsibility for packing the source object's data.
/// However, the target object (in its packAndPrepare method) may
/// ask the source object to pack its own data, if the source object
/// implements Packable.
///
/// It might make sense for Packable to inherit from SrcDistObject.
/// However, that sets up the possibility of ambiguous multiple
/// inheritance.  For example, RowGraph inherits from Packable, and
/// CrsGraph inherits from both RowGraph and DistObject.
/// Furthermore, it is not necessary for a source object of an
/// Import or Export to know how to pack itself.  The ability to
/// pack oneself is independent of the ability to be the source of
/// an Import or Export.  Packable exists mainly for syntactic
/// enforcement of the interface needed for an object to know how to
/// pack itself for an Import or Export.
