  /// \class Packable
  /// \brief Abstract base class for objects that can be the source of
  ///   an Import or Export operation, and that also know how to pack
  ///   their data to send to the target object.
  /// \tparam Packet The type of each entry of the array of packed
  ///   data to be sent in the Import or Export operation.  The type
  ///   of packed data may differ from the type of actual data stored
  ///   in the object.  For example, a sparse matrix might need to
  ///   pack both column indices (an integer type) and values
  ///   (typically, but not always, a floating-point type), and it
  ///   might choose any of various types to represent packed data.
  /// \tparam LocalOrdinal The type of local indices in the object.
  ///   This is a template parameter because the pack() method
  ///   includes as input a list of local indices to pack.  See the
  ///   documentation of Map for requirements.
  ///
  /// If an object implements Packable, then that object acknowledges
  /// that it knows how to pack its data as the source object of an
  /// Import or Export operation.  The target object in general
  /// assumes responsibility for packing the source object's data.
  /// However, the target object (in its packAndPrepare method) may
  /// ask the source object to pack its own data, if the source object
  /// implements Packable.
  ///
  /// It might make sense for Packable to inherit from SrcDistObject.
  /// However, that sets up the possibility of ambiguous multiple
  /// inheritance.  For example, RowGraph inherits from Packable, and
  /// CrsGraph inherits from both RowGraph and DistObject.
  /// Furthermore, it is not necessary for a source object of an
  /// Import or Export to know how to pack itself.  The ability to
  /// pack oneself is independent of the ability to be the source of
  /// an Import or Export.  Packable exists mainly for syntactic
  /// enforcement of the interface needed for an object to know how to
  /// pack itself for an Import or Export.
