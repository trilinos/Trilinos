/// \file Tpetra_Details_Behavior.hpp
/// \brief Declaration of Tpetra::Details::Behavior, a class that
///   describes Tpetra's behavior.

namespace Tpetra {
namespace Details {

/// \brief Description of Tpetra's behavior.
///
/// "Behavior" means things like whether to do extra debug checks or
/// print debug output.  These depend both on build options and on
/// environment variables.  Build options generally control the
/// default behavior.
///
/// This class' methods have the following properties:
///
/// <ul>
/// <li>They may read the environment.</li>
/// <li>They read the environment at most once, on first call.</li>
/// <li>They are idempotent.</li>
/// <li>They are reentrant.  For example, they may use std::call_once
///     if appropriate.</li>
/// </ul>
///
/// We intended for it to be inexpensive to call this class' methods
/// repeatedly.  The idea is that you don't have to cache variables;
/// you should just call the functions freely.  In the common case,
/// the \c bool methods should just perform an 'if' test and just
/// return the \c bool value.  We spent some time thinking about how
/// to make the methods reentrant without a possibly expensive
/// mutex-like pthread_once / std::call_once cost on each call.
///
/// Tpetra does <i>not</i> promise to see changes to environment
/// variables made after using any Tpetra class or calling any Tpetra
/// function.  Best practice would be to set any environment variables
/// that you want to set, before starting the executable.
///
/// Our main goal with this class is to give both users and developers
/// more run-time control in determining Tpetra's behavior, by setting
/// environment variables.  This makes debugging much more efficient,
/// since before, enabling debugging code would have required
/// reconfiguring and recompiling.  Not all of Tpetra has bought into
/// this system yet; some debug code is still protected by macros like
/// <tt>HAVE_TPETRA_DEBUG</tt>.  However, our goal is that as much
/// Tpetra debugging code as possible can be enabled or disabled via
/// environment variable.  This will have the additional advantage of
/// avoiding errors due to only building and testing in debug or
/// release mode, but not both.
///
/// The behavior of Tpetra can be modified at runtime through two environment
/// variables:
///
/// TPETRA_DEBUG: flags Tpetra to turn on debug checking.
/// TPETRA_VERBOSE: flags Tpetra to turn on debug _output_.
/// TPETRA_TIMING: flags Tpetra to turn on timing code.
///
/// These are two different things.  For example, TPETRA_DEBUG may do extra MPI
/// communication in order to ensure correct error state propagation, but
/// TPETRA_DEBUG should never print copious debug output if no errors occurred.
/// The idea is that if users get a mysterious error or hang, they can rerun
/// with TPETRA_DEBUG set.  TPETRA_VERBOSE is for Tpetra developers to use for
/// debugging Tpetra. TPETRA_TIMING is for Tpetra developers to use for timing
/// Tpetra.
///
/// The environment variables are understood to be "on" or "off" and recognized
/// if specified in one of two ways. The first is to specify the variable
/// unconditionally ON or OFF. e.g., TPETRA_[VERBOSE,DEBUG,TIMING]=ON or
/// TPETRA_[VERBOSE,DEBUG,TIMING]=OFF. The default value of TPETRA_VERBOSE and
/// TPETRA_TIMING is always OFF. The default value for TPETRA_DEBUG is ON if
/// Tpetra is configured with Tpetra_ENABLE_DEBUG, otherwise it is OFF.
///
/// The second is to specify the variable on a per class/object basis, e.g.,
/// TPETRA_VERBOSE=CrsGraph,CrsMatrix,Distributor means that verbose output
/// will be enabled for CrsGraph, CrsMatrix, and Distributor classes.  For this
/// second method, the default values of both TPETRA_VERBOSE and TPETRA_DEBUG
/// is OFF.
