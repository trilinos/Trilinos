/// \class BlockMultiVector
/// \brief MultiVector for multiple degrees of freedom per mesh point
/// \author Mark Hoemmen
///
/// \tparam Scalar The type of each entry of the block multivector.
///   (You can use real-valued or complex-valued types here, unlike in
///   Epetra, where the scalar type is always \c double.)
/// \tparam LO The type of local indices.  See the documentation of
///   the first template parameter of Map for requirements.
/// \tparam GO The type of global indices.  See the documentation of
///   the second template parameter of Map for requirements.
/// \tparam Node The Kokkos Node type.  See the documentation of the
///   third template parameter of Map for requirements.
///
/// BlockMultiVector is like ::Tpetra::MultiVector, but its interface
/// supports multiple degrees of freedom per mesh point.  You can
/// specify a mesh point by its local or global index, and read or
/// write the values at that point.  Every mesh point must have the
/// same number of degrees of freedom.  We call the number of degrees
/// of freedom per mesh point the <i>block size</i>.
///
/// BlockMultiVector has <i>view semantics</i>.  This means that the
/// copy constructor and assignment operator (operator=) all do
/// shallow copies.  If you want to create a deep copy, call
/// createCopy(); if you want to copy deeply between two
/// BlockMultiVector objects, call deep_copy().
///
/// The replace*, sumInto*, and get* methods all are meant to be
/// thread-safe.  They don't throw exceptions on error; instead, they
/// return an error code.  They are marked "const" because Kokkos
/// requires this in order to use them in parallel kernels.  "Const"
/// is legitimate here, even though some of these methods may modify
/// entries of the vector.  This is because they do not change any
/// constants or pointers (e.g., they do not reallocate memory).
///
/// BlockMultiVector stores entries in a column corresponding to
/// degrees of freedom for the same mesh point contiguously. 
///
/// Here is how you are supposed to use this class:
///
///   1. Fill the BlockMultiVector.
///   2. Do global assembly with BlockMultiVector, if necessary.  (It
///      implements Tpetra::DistObject, so you can use it with Import
///      or Export.)
///   3. Call getMultiVectorView() to get a Tpetra::MultiVector which
///      views the BlockMultiVector's data.
///   4. Give the Tpetra::MultiVector to Trilinos' solvers.
///
/// Note that BlockMultiVector is not a subclass of
/// ::Tpetra::MultiVector.  I did this on purpose, for simplicity.
/// You should really think of BlockMultiVector as an in-place
/// reinterpretation of a ::Tpetra::MultiVector.
///
/// This is the first Tpetra class to assume view semantics of all
/// Tpetra objects.  In particular, it assumes that Map has have view
/// semantics, so that its copy constructor and assignment operator do
/// shallow copies, and its default constructor (that takes no
/// arguments) compiles and succeeds, creating a meaningful empty
/// object.
///
/// Design philosophy of the new block objects:
/// <ol>
/// <li> Each mesh point has the same number of degrees of freedom </li>
/// <li> A BlockMultiVector <i>views</i> a MultiVector, but <i>is
///      not</i> a MultiVector (that is, BlockMultiVector is
///      <i>not</i> a subclass of MultiVector) </li>
/// </ol>
///
/// Point 1 means that users fill by mesh points, not degrees of
/// freedom.  Thus, they mainly care about the distribution of mesh
/// points, not so much about what GID we assign to which degree of
/// freedom.  The latter is just another Map (the "point Map") from
/// their perspective, if they care at all.  Preconditioners that
/// respect the block structure also just want the mesh Map.
/// Iterative linear solvers treat the matrix and preconditioner as
/// black-box operators.  This means that they only care about the
/// domain and range point Maps.
///
/// The latter motivates Point 2.  BlockMultiVector views a
/// MultiVector, and iterative solvers (and users) can access the
/// MultiVector and work with it directly, along with its (point) Map.
/// It doesn't make sense for BlockMultiVector to implement
/// MultiVector, because the desired fill interfaces of the two
/// classes are different.
