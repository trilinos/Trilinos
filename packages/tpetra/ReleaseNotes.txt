-----------------------------------------
Release Notes for Trilinos Package Tpetra
-----------------------------------------

Trilinos 11.0: 
--------------
* Significant performance improvements to local sparse matrix-vector multiply on CPU nodes. 
* Removed all deprecated methods.

Trilinos 10.12:
--------------

* Major (backwards-compatible, internal) refactor to interaction between Tpetra::CrsGraph/CrsMatrix and their interaction 
  with their LocalSparseOps template parameter. 
* Removed generic kernels for GPU nodes; GPU sparse kernel support now provided by CUSPARSE library; requires CUDA 4.1
* Additional methods in Reduction/Transformation Interface (RTI) interface, examples in tpetra/examples/MultiPrec
* Fixed major bugs in Tpetra Import/Export
* Minor bug fixes and documenting tests
* Numerous improvements to documentation
* Better MatrixMarket support in tpetra/util
* Added the ability to construct a Tpetra::Vector/MultiVector using user data (host-based nodes only)
- Deprecated: fillComplete(OptimizeStorageOption) on Tpetra::CrsGraph and Tpetra::CrsMatrix, in favor of a ParameterList.


Trilinos 10.7:
--------------

* Added (experimental) Reduction/Transformation Interface (RTI) interface to tpetra/rti, examples in tpetra/examples/RTInterface

Trilinos 10.6.4:
----------------

* Fixed some bugs in the build system
* Updates to support CUDA 4.0 and built-in Thrust

Trilinos 10.6.1:
----------------

* Added new HybridPlatform examples, under tpetra/examples/HybridPlatform. Anasazi and Belos examples are currently not built, though they are functional.
* Added Added new MultiVector GEMM tests, to evaluate potential interference of TPI/TBB threads and a threaded BLAS, to tpetra/test/MultiVector.
* Added Tpetra timers to Anasazi and Belos adaptors.
* Added test/documentation build of Tpetra::CrsMatrix against KokkosExamples::DummySpasreKernelClass
* Fixed some bugs, added some bug verification tests, disabled by default.

Trilinos 10.6:
--------------

Significant internal changes in Tpetra for this release, mostly centered around
the CrsMatrix class. Lots of new features centering around multi-core/GPUs did
not make it in this release; look for more development in 10.6.1.

* Lots of additional documentation, testing and examples in Tpetra.
* Imported select Teuchos memory management classes/methods into the Tpetra namespace.
* Updates to the Anasazi/Tpetra adaptors for efficiency, node-awareness and debugging.
* Minor bug fixes, warnings addressed.

Changes breaking backwards compatbility:
* Tpetra CRS objects (i.e., CrsGraph and CrsMatrix) are required to be "fill-active" in order to be modified.
  Furthermore, they are requried to be "fill-complete" in order to call multiply/solve.
  The transition between these states is mediated by the methods fillComplete() and resumeFill(). 
  This will only effect users that modify a matrix after calling fillComplete().

Newly deprecated functionality:
* CrsGraph/CrsMatrix persisting views of graph and matrix data are now
  deprecated. New, non-persisting versions of these are provided.


Trilinos 10.4:
--------------

The Trilinos release 10.4 came at an unfortunate time, as we were in the middle
of a medium refactor in Kokkos/Tpetra in order to better support GPU and
multicore nodes. Therefore, there has been some potential regression in performance
for GPU nodes; and some known issues regarding multi-core CPU performance (especially 
on NUMA platforms) have not been addressed. The rest of this refactor is likely to happen 
in the development branch, and will not be released until 10.6 (estimated for September 2010). 

Users that require access to this code should contact a Trilinos developer regarding access to the 
development branch repository. 

(*) Improvements to doxygen documentation.
- added ifdefs to support profiling/tracing of host-to-device memory transfers 
  These are enable via cmake options
  -D KokkosClassic_ENABLE_CUDA_NODE_MEMORY_PROFILING:BOOL=ON
  -D KokkosClassic_ENABLE_CUDA_NODE_MEMORY_TRACE:BOOL=ON

(*) VBR capability (experimental)
- added variable-block row matrix (VbrMatrix) and underlying support classes (BlockMap, BlockMultiVector)
- added power method example of VBR classes

(*) CrsMatrix:
- now implements DisbObject, allowing import/export capability with CrsMatrix objects (experimental)
- combined LocalMatVec and LocalMatSolve objects into a single template parameter. (non BC)
  this required changes to CrsMatrixMultplyOp and CrsMatrixSolveOp operators as well. (non BC)
- access default for this type via Kokkos::DefaultKernels
- removed cached views of object data. this should have no effect on CPU-based nodes, but will result in slower performance
  for GPU-based nodes. this regression is a result of the release happening mid-refactor. it will not be addressed in the 
  10.4.x sequence.
- bug fixes regarding complex cases involving user-specified column maps and graphs.

(*) DistObject interface:
- added createViews(), releaseViews() methods to allow host-based objects to temporarily cache views of host data during import/export procedure

(*) Map: 
- added new non-member constructors: createContigMap(), createWeightedContigMap(), createUniformContigMap()
- fixed some bugs regarding use of unsigned Ordinal types
- fixed MPI-stalling bug in getRemoteIndexList()

(*) MultiVector:
- added view methods offsetView() and offsetViewNonConst() to create a MultiVector view of a subset of rows
- added non-member constructor Tpetra::createMultiVector(map,numVecs)

(*) Vector:
- added non-member constructor Tpetra::createVector(map)

(*) Tpetra I/O:
- added Galeri-type methods for generating pedagogical matrices (currently, only 3D Laplacian)

(*) External adaptors (experiemental)
- Efficiency improvements for Belos/Tpetra adaptors
- Brought Anasazi/Tpetra adaptors back online
