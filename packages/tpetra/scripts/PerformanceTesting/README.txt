These directories (eclipse, stria, vortex) should be placed in the
trilinos-performance SEMS data store, in a subdirectory 'Scripts'.

This is accessible on the SRN machine 'sherlock' at
/storage/elements/sems-data-store/trilinos-performance/Scripts

The Jenkins jobs download these scripts from the data store.
