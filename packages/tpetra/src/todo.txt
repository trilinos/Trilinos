* [Bugs] Possible bug: CrsGraph import/export checks fillComplete() when perhaps it should check indicesAreLocal/indicesAreGlobal. See if this makes a bug.

* Add first-touch

* Add new resumeFill()
  - This should look like the constructors for CrsGraph/CrsMatrix
    resumeFill(ProfileType, NNZ)
    resumeFill(ProfileType, NNZPerRow)
  - Semantically, constructor is just a resume-fill
  - Need to address efficiency issues here (vis-à-vis memory usage)
  - Need to figure out what to do with Kokkos::CrsMatrix; probably split into abstract interface with multiple base classes
    + Kokkos::CrsMatrixPacked
    + Kokkos::CrsMatrix1D
    + Kokkos::CrsMatrix2D
    + No node template. This is a host-only class.
  - optimizeStorage() or fillComplete(DoOptimizeStorage) means the use can never add new entries to a CrsMatrix. What does this mean in the context of other DistObjects?

* Add re-use option for allocBuffer()

* Coalesce LocalMatVec and LocalMatSolvein CrsMatrix
  + Node dependency.

* Address REPLACE mode in CrsMatrix/CrsGraph import/export

* add Kokkos-level parallelCopy() and parallelPermute() (compute kernels, not node-member memory primitives)
  - may need to address overlapping
    + detection with fall-back to serial is okay for now; identify potential special cases in Tpetra usage
  - Use these in CrsMatrix/CrsGraph/MultiVector/Vector (doImport/doExport)

* Rewrite globalAssemble() in CrsMatrix/CrsGraph to use import/export functionality

* Coalesce fillComplete() code from CrsMatrix into CrsGraph (fill with values)
  - Do this with other duplicated methods where possible (i.e., insertion methods)
  - Don't worry about multi-matrix/one-graph yet; prolly wait for varaidic templates

* Determine appropriate impelementation of checkSizes() in CrsGraph/CrsMatrix

* [As needed in the future] Add Tpetra::MultiScalarOperator abstract interface.
