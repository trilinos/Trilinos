    \mainpage Trilinos/Tpetra: Templated Linear Algebra Services Package

   \section tpetra_intro Introduction to Tpetra

Tpetra is an attempt at applying generic algorithm techniques to the
serial and parallel linear algebra libraries of Epetra.  It is hoped that
Tpetra will complement Epetra by providing an alternative foundation 
for future Trilinos solvers.  The lessons learned and discoveries made 
while creating Tpetra are also being applied to improving their Epetra cousins.

Tpetra provides the same functionality as Epetra: the fundamental construction
routines and services functions that are required for serial and parallel
linear algebra libraries.  Unlike Epetra, Tpetra makes extensive use of
templates and the Standard Template Library (STL).  This provides numerous
benefits, including the ability to template the ordinal and scalar fields on
any well-defined types, and the use of automatic resource allocation. 

Tpetra captures a significant subset of the functionality present in the Epetra
package. Functionality not included is either a consequence of different design
motivations or of Tpetra's status as a work in progress.

\section startup Overview of Tpetra

\subsection types Templated Types in Tpetra

All of all classes in Tpetra utilize templates, which allows the user to
specify any type they want. In some cases, the choice of data type allows
increased functionality. For example, 64-bit ordinals allow for problem sizes
to break the 2 billion element barrier present in Epetra, whereas complex
scalar types allow the native description and solution of complex-valued
problems.

Most of the classes in Tpetra are templated according to the data types which constitute the class. 
These are the following:
    - \c Scalar: A \c Scalar is the data structure used for storing values.
       This is the type most likely to be changed by many users. The most common use cases are \c float,
       \c double, <tt>complex<float></tt> and <tt>complex<double></tt>. However, any data type can be
       used so long as it implements Teuchos::ScalarTraits and supports the necessary arithmetic operations, such 
       as addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.
    - \c LocalOrdinal: A \c LocalOrdinal is used to store indices representing local IDs. The standard use case,
      as well as the default for most classes, is \c int. Any type can be used that implements Teuchos::OrdinalTraits
      and supports the necessary arithmetic. The purpose of template local and global ordinals as two (possibly)
      different types is for efficiency purposes. For example, the indices of a completed CrsGraph contain objects
      of type \c LocalOrdinal. If the specific application allows it, using smaller local ordinals requires 
      less storage and potentially higher rates of computation.
    - \c GlobalOrdinal: A \c GlobalOrdinal is used to store indices representing global IDs and to describe 
      global properties of a distributed object (e.g., global number of non-zeros in a sparse matrix, global number
      of rows in a vector.) The \c GlobalOrdinal therefore dictates the maximum size of a distributed object.

The Tpetra::Distributor class is unique in that it is not templated instantiated on any templated types. However, 
the class includes some templated member functions. The Tpetra::Distributor::createFromRecvs() method is templated on the 
ordinal type used to encode IDs, while Tpetra::Distributor::doPosts() and the other post methods are templated 
on the \c Packet, the data type being communicated by a particular invocation of the Tpetra::Distributor.

\subsection formulations Tpetra Classes

Tpetra contains a number of classes. The primary parallel classes, employed by most users, are:

 - Communication classes: Tpetra::Platform and Teuchos::Comm <br>
     - Comm provides collective operations among nodes. The abstraction of the communication allows
       Tpetra objects to be coded to a generic communicator, which may be specified by the user 
       as one of a number of available communicators (e.g., Teuchos::MpiComm, Teuchos::SerialComm).
       Teuchos::Comm is analogous to Epetra_Comm.
     - Tpetra::Platform contains specific information about the parallel machine we are using. 
       Currently, Tpetra::Platform exists to provide a communicator object. It is anticipated that 
       future versions of Tpetra will utilize Tpetra::Platform to collect other information about the node 
       on which the computations are being executed. Current implementations are Tpetra::SerialPlatform 
       and Tpetra::MpiPlatform. Future work will provide platforms specific to multi-core nodes, such as 
       homogenous multicore CPUs and GPUs.

 -  Map class: Tpetra::Map <br>
     Contain information used to distribute vectors, matrices and other objects. This class is analogous
     to the class Epetra_Map.

 -  Distributed vector class: Tpetra::MultiVector, Tpetra::Vector <br>
     Provides vector services such as scaling, norms, and dot products. 

 -  Distributed sparse matrix classes: Tpetra::RowMatrix, Tpetra::CrsMatrix <br>
     Tpetra::RowMatrix is a abstract interface for row-distributed sparse matrices. Tpetra::CrsMatrix is a 
     specific implementation of Tpetra::RowMatrix, utilizing compressed row storage format. Both of these
     classes derive from Tpetra::Operator, the base class for linear operators.

 - Import/Export classes:  Tpetra::Import and Tpetra::Export <br>
     Allows efficient transfer of objects built using one mapping 
     to a new object with a new mapping.  Supports local and global permutations,
     overlapping Schwarz operations and many other data movement operations.

\subsection trilinos Trilinos and Tpetra

Tpetra can be used mostly as a stand-alone package, with an explicit dependence only on Teuchos. There are adapters allowing the 
use of Tpetra operators and multivectors in both the Belos linear solver package and the Anasazi eigensolver package.
