1. Everything should be in namespace Tpetra.

2. When more than one template argument is used, they should be ordered from most general to most specific: PacketType, OrdinalType, ScalarType.
		Right: <OrdinalType, ScalarType>
		Wrong: <ScalarType, PacketType>

3. All header files should be bracketed with a preprocessor directive to prevent multiple inclusion. This should be the name of the file, in all uppercase, with an underscore between words, as well as at the beginning and end. Example:
		#ifndef _TPETRA_SOMEHEADER_HPP_
		#define _TPETRA_SOMEHEADER_HPP_

		...

		#endif // _TPETRA_SOMEHEADER_HPP_

4. When multiple closing braces occur in sequence, add comments to make it easier to determine which goes with which.

5. Placement of const: For consistency, and so that certain macro-expansions work, const is to follow whatever is being made const.

		variable:												int const 				someVar
		reference to variable:					int const & 			someRef
		non-const pointer to const obj:	int const * 			somePtr
		const pointer to non-const obj:	int 			* const somePtr
		const pointer to const obj:			int const * const somePtr

This also makes const usage consistent with functions and function return types.

6. The name of a class's data member(s) should end with an underscore. 

7. All variable and instance names should start with a lowercase letter, and use an uppercase letter for the beginning of each subsequent rule. There are two exceptions to this rule: 1) A member that is a pointer or reference to an object may start with an uppercase letter to show that it represents a seperate object. 2) Acronyms occuring in names should be capitalized the way they would be in English, even if the acronym occurs at the beginning of a variable name.

8. Member initializations in a constructor should be in the same order as the members are listed in the class declaration.

9. Code should be written Java-style, with the function definitions inline with the function declarations in the class's *.hpp file.

10. Prefer member initialization to member assignment in constructor body.

11. If a class has non-trivial data members, always declare a default constructor, a copy constructor, a destructor, and an assignment operator. You don't need to define them, but always declare them. This will prevent the compiler from adding in those functions, which it will usually write poorly. This way, if someone tries to use one of those functions, it will be a compile-time error instead of working but potentially producing the Wrong behavior. Always document these declarations as such.

12. The opening curly bracket of a function should be on the same line as the arguments, except if the arguments take up more than one line. Then the opening curly bracket should be on its own line. 

13. If the arguments for a function take up more than one line, then they should be formatted so that the first argument is on the same line as the name of the function, and each subsequent argument should be on its own line.

14. Member initializations in a constructor should be formatted one per line, with the semicolon or comma preceding the initialization. This allows us to add, remove, and comment out individual lines without having to change the surrounding code. Example:
	SomeClass()
		: classMember1_()
		, classMember2_()
		, classMember3_()
	{
		// constructor body

15. Indents should be 2 characters wide.
