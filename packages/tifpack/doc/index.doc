    \mainpage Trilinos/Tifpack: Templated Preconditioning Package

   \section tifpack_intro Introduction to Tifpack

Tifpack provides templated preconditioning algorithms using linear algebra
objects (matrices, operators, multivectors) provided by the Tpetra package.

Tifpack will (when finished) provide the same functionality as the Ifpack
package (which uses Epetra linear algebra objects).

\section startup Overview of Tifpack

\subsection types Templated Types in Tifpack

All classes in Tifpack utilize templates. Most of the preconditioner classes
are templated on the type of the input matrix. This allows the user to provide
any Tpetra matrix (i.e., templated on any of the Scalar/Ordinal/Node/etc types
that are possible with Tpetra).

\subsection precs Tifpack Preconditioners

All Tifpack preconditioners inherit the base class Tifpack::Preconditioner.

The preconditioners that are supported in the current release are:
<ul>
<li> Tifpack::Relaxation
<li> Tifpack::Chebyshev
<li> Tifpack::ILUT
<li> Tifpack::RILUK
</ul>

\subsection trilinos Trilinos and Tifpack

Tifpack preconditioners can be used with the solver algorithms in the
Trilinos/Belos package.

\subsection Examples

A test program (tifpack/test/belos) is provided which demonstrates creating
and using Tifpack preconditioners with Belos solvers. The test program is
entirely driven by XML input files, which specify the matrix file to be used,
as well as parameters for the preconditioner, and the belos solver, etc.
