/** \brief Base <tt>%VectorSpaceBase</tt> class for all SPMD vector spaces
 * with contiguous local-to-global indexing.
 *
 * See <tt>SpmdVectorSpaceBase</tt> for details on what this class represents
 * in an abstract way.
 *
 * <b>Notes to subclass developers:</b>
 *
 * The pure virtual methods <tt>mpiComm()</tt>, <tt>localSubDim()</tt> and
 * <tt>createMember()</tt> are the only functions that must be overridden.
 *
 * If <tt>this</tt> this is in an uninitialized state then
 * <tt>localSubDim()</tt> should return <tt>0</tt>.
 *
 * It should never be necessary to override the virtual functions
 * <tt>mapCode()</tt> and <tt>isCompatible()</tt> as these functions
 * have very good and very general implementations.
 *
 * If optimized implementations of multi-vectors can be supported,
 * then the <tt>createMembers()</tt> method should also be overridden.
 *
 * This class defines a very general default implementation for
 * <tt>smallVecSpcFcty()</tt> that returns a
 * <tt>DefaultSpmdVectorSpaceFactory</tt> object which in turn can be used to
 * create <tt>DefaultSpmdVectorSpace</tt> objects.  These are the vector space
 * objects that are used by the domain space of multi-vectors created by
 * <tt>createMembers()</tt>.  The class <tt>DefaultSpmdVectorSpace</tt>
 * creates <tt>DefaultSpmdVector</tt> and <tt>DefaultSpmdMultiVector</tt>
 * objects.  This implementation of <tt>smallVecSpcFcty()</tt> is very general
 * should be very appropriate for many different concrete implementations.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> It is very important that subclasses call the
 * <tt>updateState()</tt> function whenever the state of <tt>*this</tt>
 * changes in a way that might affect the behavior of any of the public member
 * functions.  For example, if a different value of <tt>localSubDim()</tt>
 * will be returned the next time it is called by a client, then
 * <tt>%updateState()</tt> needs to be called by the subclass.  External
 * clients should never need to worry about this function and that is why
 * <tt>%updateState()</tt> is declared protected.

   * rank, then <tt>localOffset</tt> on each of these processes will be set
   * as: <tt>localOffset=0</tt> on process 0, <tt>localOffset=5</tt> on

   * <tt>localSubDim()</tt> on each process and then uses it to compute a
   * value for <tt>mapCode</tt> (using a single global reduction if
   * <tt>numProc > 1</tt>) which is returned from this function.
   *
   * The value returned from this default implementation of this
   * method must not be changed or this approach breaks down.  The
   * only reason for overriding this method is for the subclass to
   * be alerted of <em>when</em> this method is called but not
   * <em>what</em> is returned from this method.  If a subclass
   * developer does not understand what this means then <b>don't</b>
   * override this method!
   *
   * The default implementation will always return <tt>return >
   * 0</tt> (unless <tt>this</tt> is uninitialized) so that if this
   * method is overridden to return <tt>return <= </tt> then this is
   * a flag that the underlying vector map does not satisfy the
   * assumptions of this vector space interface and vectors that are
   * in <tt>*this</tt> vector space can not collaborate with other
