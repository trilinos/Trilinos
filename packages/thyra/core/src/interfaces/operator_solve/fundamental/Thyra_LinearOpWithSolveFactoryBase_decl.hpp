 * objects from compatible <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> objects.

 *
 * \section LOWSFB_intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This strategy interface allows a client to take one or more "compatible"
 * <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> objects and then create one or more
 * <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> objects that can then be used to solve for
 * linear systems.  This interface carefully separates the construction from
 * the initialization of a <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> object.
 *
 * Note that the non-member functions defined \ref
 * Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryBase_helper_grp "here" provide for simpler
 * use cases and are demonstrated in the example code below.
 *
 * This interface can be implemented by both direct and iterative linear
 * solvers.
 *
 * This interface supports the concept of an external preconditioner that can
 * be created by the client an passed into the function
 * <tt>initializePreconditionedOp()</tt>
 *
 * \section LOWSFB_use_cases_sec Use cases
 *
 * The following use cases demonstrate and specify the behavior of this
 * interface in several different situations.  These use cases don't cover
 * very possible variation but implementors and clients should get a pretty
 * good idea of the desired behavior from what is specified below.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> All of the code fragments shown in the below use cases is code
 * that is compiled and run automatically by the test harness and the code
 * fragments are automatically pulled into this HTML documentation whenever
 * the documentation is rebuilt.  Therefore, one can have a very high degree
 * of confidence that the code shown in these examples is correct.
 *
 * The following use cases are described below:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>\ref LOWSFB_single_linear_solve_sec
 * <li>\ref LOWSFB_scaled_adjoint_sec
 * <li>\ref LOWSFB_updated_of_linear_op_sec
 * <li>\ref LOWSFB_reuse_of_factorization_sec
 * <li>\ref LOWSFB_major_changes_in_op_sec
 * <li>\ref LOWSFB_external_prec_sec
 *   <ul>
 *   <li>\ref LOWSFB_external_prec_op_sec
 *   <li>\ref LOWSFB_external_prec_mat_sec
 *   <li>\ref LOWSFB_external_prec_op_reuse_sec
 *   <li>\ref LOWSFB_external_prec_mat_reuse_sec
 *   </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * \subsection LOWSFB_single_linear_solve_sec Performing a single linear solve given a forward operator
 *
 * Performing a single linear solve is at minimum a two step process.  The
 * following example function shows how to take a <tt>LinearOpBase</tt>
 * object, a compatible <tt>LinearOpWithSolveFactoryBase</tt> object, a RHS
 * and a LHS and then solve the linear system using the default solve
 * criteria:
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin singleLinearSolve
 * \skip template
 * \until end singleLinearSolve
 *
 * See the documentation for the <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> interface for
 * how to specify solve criteria, how to perform adjoint (i.e. transpose)
 * solve, and how to solve systems with multiple RHSs.
 *
 * Note that the forward operator <tt>A</tt> is passed into this function
 * <tt>singleLinearSolve(...)</tt> as a raw object reference and not as a
 * <tt>Teuchos::RCP</tt> wrapped object since no persisting
 * relationship with this object will be last after this function exists, even
 * if an exception is thrown.
 *
 * Also note that once the above function exits that all memory of the
 * invertible operator created as part of the <tt>invertibleA</tt> object will
 * be erased.  The following use cases show more sophisticated uses of these
 * interfaces.
 *
 * \subsection LOWSFB_scaled_adjoint_sec Creating invertible operators for scaled and/or adjoint forward operators
 *
 * This interface requires that all good implementations support implicitly
 * scaled and adjoint (or transposed) forward operators.  The following
 * example function shows how this looks:
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin createScaledAdjointLinearOpWithSolve
 * \skip template
 * \until end createScaledAdjointLinearOpWithSolve
 *
 * In the above example, the functions <tt>adjoint()</tt> and <tt>scale()</tt>
 * create an implicitly scaled adjoint operator of type
 * <tt>DefaultScaledAdjointLinearOp</tt> which is then unwrapped by the
 * <tt>lowsFactory</tt> implementation.  The idea is that any operation that
 * works with a particular forward operator <tt>A</tt> should automatically
 * work with an implicitly scaled and/or adjoint view of that forward
 * operator.  The specification of this interface actually says that all
 * <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> objects that support the abstract mix-in interface
 * <tt>ScaledAdjointLinearOpBase</tt> will allow this feature.
 *
 * Above also note that the forward operator <tt>A</tt> is passed in as a
 * <tt>Teuchos::RCP</tt> wrapped object since it will be used to
 * create a persisting relationship with the returned
 * <tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> object.  Also note that the
 * <tt>lowsFactory</tt> object is still passed in as a raw object reference
 * since no persisting relationship with <tt>lowsFactory</tt> is created as a
 * side effect of calling this function.  Remember, the specification of this
 * interface requires that the returned <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> objects
 * be independent from the <tt>lowsFactory</tt> object that creates them.  In
 * other words, once a <tt>LinearOpWithSolveFactoryBase</tt> object creates a
 * <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> object, then the
 * <tt>LinearOpWithSolveFactoryBase</tt> object can be deleted and the
 * <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> it created must still be valid.
 *
 * \subsection LOWSFB_updated_of_linear_op_sec Updates of linear operator between linear solves
 *
 * In this use case is comprised of:
 * <ul>
 * <li> Creating a <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> object from a <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> object
 * <li> Using the <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> object to solve one or more linear systems
 * <li> Modifying the <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> object and reinitializing the <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> object
 * <li> Using the updated <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> object to solve one or more linear systems
 * </ul>
 *
 * The below code fragment shows how this looks.
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin solveNumericalChangeSolve
 * \skip template
 * \until end solveNumericalChangeSolve
 *
 * In the above code fragment the call to the function
 * <tt>lowsFactory.uninitializeOp(&*invertibleA)</tt> may not fully
 * uninitialize the <tt>*invertibleA</tt> object as it may contain memory of a
 * factorization structure, or a communication pattern, or whatever may have
 * been computed in the first call to
 * <tt>lowsFactory.initializeOp(rcpA,&*invertibleA)</tt>.  This allows for a
 * more efficient reinitialization on the second call of
 * <tt>lowsFactory.initializeOp(rcpA,&*invertibleA)</tt>.
 *
 * \subsection LOWSFB_reuse_of_factorization_sec Reuse of factorizations for small changes in the forward operator
 *
 * This interface supports the notion of the reuse of all factorizations or
 * other expensive preprocessing used in the last initialization of the
 * <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> object.  The primary use for this is the
 * reuse of a preconditioner for small changes in the matrix values.  While
 * this approach generally is not very effective in many cases, there are some
 * cases, such as in transient solvers, where this has been shown to be
 * effective in some problems.
 *
 * The below example function shows what this looks like:
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin solveSmallNumericalChangeSolve
 * \skip template
 * \until end solveSmallNumericalChangeSolve
 *
 * Note that the <tt>*invertibleA</tt> object reinitialized in the second
 * call to <tt>lowsFactory.initializeAndReuseOp(rcpA,&*invertibleA)</tt> must
 * be able to correctly solve the linear systems to an appropriate accuracy.
 * For example, a preconditioned iterative linear solver might keep the same
 * preconditioner but would use the updated forward operator to define the
 * linear system.  A direct solver can not reuse the factorization unless it
 * has an iterative refinement feature (which uses the updated forward
 * operator) or some other device.  Or a direct solver might, for instance,
 * reuse the same factorization structure and not re-pivot where it might
 * re-pivot generally.
 *
 * \subsection LOWSFB_major_changes_in_op_sec Updating the linear solver for major changes in the structure of the forward operator
 *
 * A major change in the shape or structure of a forward operator generally
 * eliminates the possibility of reusing any computations between different
 * calls to <tt>initializeOp()</tt>.  In these instances, the client might as
 * well just recreate the <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> using <tt>createOp()</tt>
 * before the reinitialization.
 *
 * The below example function shows what this looks like:
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin solveMajorChangeSolve
 * \skip template
 * \until end solveMajorChangeSolve
 *
 * \subsection LOWSFB_external_prec_sec Externally defined preconditioners
 *
 * This interface also supports the use of externally defined preconditioners
 * that are created and controlled by the client.  Client-created and
 * client-controlled preconditioners can be passed along with the forward
 * operator through the function initializePreconditionedOp().  Only
 * <tt>LinearOpWithSolveFactoryBase</tt> objects that return
 * <tt>supportsPreconditionerType()==true</tt> will support externally defined
 * preconditioners.  In general, iterative linear solver implementations will
 * support externally defined preconditioners and direct linear solver
 * implementations will not.
 *
 * Externally defined preconditioners can be passed in as operators or as
 * matrices and these two sub use cases are described below.
 *
 * \subsubsection LOWSFB_external_prec_op_sec Use of externally defined preconditioner operators
 *
 * The client can use externally defined preconditioner linear operator(s) for
 * <tt>LinearOpWithSolveFactoryBase</tt> objects that accept preconditioners.
 * Preconditioner operator(s) are specified through the
 * <tt>PreconditionerBase</tt> interface.  A <tt>PreconditionerBase</tt>
 * object is essentially an encapsulation of a left, right, or split left/right
 * preconditioner.
 *
 * <b>Using an externally defined <tt>PreconditionerBase</tt> object</b>
 *
 * Given an externally defined <tt>PreconditionerBase</tt> object, the client
 * can pass it allow with a forward linear operator to initialize a
 * <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> object as shown in the following code
 * fragment:
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin createGeneralPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 * \skip template
 * \until end createGeneralPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 *
 * <b>Using a single externally defined <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> object as an unspecified preconditioner</b>
 *
 * A client can easily use any compatible appropriately defined
 * <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> object as a preconditioner operator.  To do so, it can
 * just be wrapped by the default <tt>PreconditionerBase</tt> implementation
 * class <tt>DefaultPreconditioner</tt>.
 *
 * The following code fragment shows show to use an externally defined
 * <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> object as a preconditioner operator without
 * specifying whether it should be applied on the right or on the left.
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin createUnspecifiedPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 * \skip template
 * \until end createUnspecifiedPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 *
 * <b>Using a single externally defined <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> object as a left preconditioner</b>
 *
 * An externally defined <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> object can be used as a
 * preconditioner operator targeted as a left preconditioner as shown in the
 * following code fragment:
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin createLeftPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 * \skip template
 * \until end createLeftPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 *
 * <b>Using a single externally defined <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> object as a right preconditioner</b>
 *
 * An externally defined <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> object can be used as a
 * preconditioner operator targeted as a right preconditioner as shown in the
 * following code fragement:
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin createRightPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 * \skip template
 * \until end createRightPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 *
 * <b>Using two single externally defined <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> objects as a split left/right preconditioner</b>
 *
 * Two externally defined <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> objects can be used as
 * preconditioner operators for form a split preconditioner targeted to the
 * left and right as shown in the following code fragement:
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin createLeftRightPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 * \skip template
 * \until end createLeftRightPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 *
 * \subsubsection LOWSFB_external_prec_mat_sec The use of externally defined preconditioner matrices
 *
 * A different linear operator can be used to build a preconditioner
 * internally when initializing a <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> object.  The
 * following code fragement shows how to use an approximate forward linear
 * from which to form a preconditioner internally:
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin createMatrixPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 * \skip template
 * \until end createMatrixPreconditionedLinearOpWithSolve
 *
 * \subsubsection LOWSFB_external_prec_op_reuse_sec Reuse of externally defined preconditioner operators
 *
 * Reusing an externally defined preconditioner is a very straightforward
 * matter conceptually.  Since the client controls the creation and
 * initialization of the preconditioner, the client can control which
 * preconditioners are paired with which forward operators in order to form
 * <tt>LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> objects.  However, when an abstract
 * <tt>PreconditionerFactoryBase</tt> object is used to create and maintain
 * the preconditioner, the exact nature of the preconditioner after the
 * operator is updated is undefined.  The following code fragment show a use
 * case where the operator is reused without explicitly updating the
 * preconditioner between solves:
 *
 * \dontinclude Thyra_LinearOpWithSolveFactoryExamples.hpp
 * \skip begin externalPreconditionerReuseWithSolves
 * \skip template
 * \until end externalPreconditionerReuseWithSolves
 *
 * \subsubsection LOWSFB_external_prec_mat_reuse_sec Reuse of externally defined preconditioner matrices
 *
 * This interface does not guarantee the correct reuse of externally defined
 * preconditioner matrices.  The problem is that the internally generated
 * preconditioner may be dependent on the input preconditioner matrix and it
 * is not clear for the current interface design how to cleanly handle this
 * use case.  However, when the client knows that the internally generated
 * preconditioner operator is independent from the externally defined
 * preconditioner input matrix, then the function
 * <tt>initializeAndReuseOp()</tt> can be called to reuse the internal
 * preconditioner but this is implementation defined.
 *
 * \section LOWSFB_verbosity_level_sec Output and verbosity
 *
 * <b>TODO:</b> Provide some guidance on how clients and subclasses should
 * interpret Teuchos::EVerbLevel.
 *
 * \section LOWSFB_developer_notes_sec Notes to subclass developers
 *
 * This interface assumes a minimal default set of functionality that is
 * appropriate for direct and simple iterative linear solver implementations.
 * The pure virtual functions that must be overridden by a subclass are
 * <tt>isCompatible()</tt>, <tt>createOp()</tt>, <tt>initializeOp()</tt>, and
 * <tt>uninitializeOp()</tt>.  By far the most complex function to implement
 * is <tt>initializeOp()</tt> which is where the real guts of the factory
 * method is defined.
 *
 * If the concrete subclass can support some significant type of preprocessing
 * reuse then it may override to function <tt>initializeAndReuseOp()</tt>.
 * The most common use of this function it to support the reuse of
 * preconditioners between small changes in forward operator matrix values.
 *
 * If the concrete subclass can utilize a preconditioner, then it should
 * override the functions <tt>supportsPreconditionerInputType()</tt> and
 * <tt>initializePreconditionedOp()</tt>.  The subclass implementation can
 * decide if preconditioner operators and/or matrices are supported or not and
 * this is determined by the return value from
 * <tt>supportsPreconditionerInputType()</tt>.
