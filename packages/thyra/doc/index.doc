\section thyra_intro_sec Introduction

The %Thyra package contains a set of interfaces and supporting code that
defines basic interoperability mechanisms between different types of numerical
software.  The foundation of all the interfaces related to abstract numerical
algorithms (ANAs) are the mathematical concepts of vectors, vector spaces, and
linear operators.  All other ANA interfaces and support software are built on
these fundamental operator/vector interfaces.

This main page provides the starting point for all of the documentation for
%Thyra interfaces and software.  This documentation is generated using
Doxygen.

The documentation for %Thyra is broken up into a number of different doxygen
collections as described in the next section.


\section thyra_software_sec Thyra Software Package Documentation Collections

The Doxygen-generated documentation is broken up into a number of different
doxygen collections in an attempt to make each individual collection more
manageable to browse and comprehend.  To access each separate collection, just
click on the [doxygen collection] next to each header below.

The thrya package is broadly divided into interoperability interfaces and
support software and the directory structure and the doxygen documentation is
also divided in this way.  This organization mirrors the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of thyra</a>.


\subsection thyra_interfaces_sec Thyra interoperability interfaces


All of the software in the <tt>src/interfaces</tt> directory define
fundamental interoperability interfaces needed to glue code together.  This is
the most critical aspect of %Thyra.  In addition, interfaces are also
partitioned between <em>fundamental</em> interfaces and <em>extended</em>
interfaces.


\subsubsection thyra_interfaces_operator_vector_sec Operator/Vector Interfaces

<ul>

<li> <b>Fundamental ANA Operator/Vector Interfaces</b> <a
name="interfaces_operator_vector_ana_fundamental"></a>

\image html ThyraOperatorVectorSimple.gif

This minimal set of basic operator/vector interfaces described here forms
the foundation for all of the interoperability interfaces related to
Abstract Numerical Algorithms (ANAs) provided in the %Thyra package.

The fundamental interface classes shown in the above UML class diagram are
described below:

  <ul>
  
  <li><tt>Thyra::VectorSpaceFactoryBase</tt> is the basic factory interface for
  creating <tt>Thyra::VectorSpaceBase</tt> objects given a dimension.
  
  <li><tt>Thyra::VectorSpaceBase</tt> is the fundamental abstract interface for
  a vector space that defines the scalar product and factory functions for
  creating <tt>Thyra::VectorBase</tt> and <tt>Thyra::MultiVectorBase</tt>
  objects.
  
  <li><tt>Thyra::VectorBase</tt> is the fundamental abstract interface for
  finite-dimensional vectors.
  
  <li><tt>Thyra::LinearOpBase</tt> is the fundamental abstract interface for
  linear operators.
  
  <li><tt>Thyra::MultiVectorBase</tt> is the fundamental abstract interface for
  collections of column vectors.
  
  </ul>

These interface classes rely on a few \ref Thyra_Op_Vec_BasicTypes_grp
"basic types"
and \ref Thyra_Op_Vec_Exceptions_grp "basic exception classes".

One important paper describing the RTOp approach, which provides the
foundation for <tt>RTOpPack::RTOpT</tt>, can be found in <a
href="http://software.sandia.gov/RTOp/RTOpTOMS.pdf">this paper</a>.  Note that
<tt>RTOpPack::RTOpT</tt> is a refinement of the C and C++ RTOp interfaces
described in the aforementioned paper.

<li><b>Extended ANA Operator/Vector Interfaces</b><a
name="interfaces_operator_vector_ana_extended"></a>

These are some interfaces based on the
above Fundamental ANA Operator/Vector Interfaces and provide other pieces of functionality
and define new types of interoperability.  For example, this is where interfaces to various
types of <em>composite</em> subclasses exist for product, or block, vector spaces
(<tt>Thyra::ProductVectorSpaceBase</tt>), vectors (<tt>Thyra::ProductVectorBase</tt>),
and multi-vectors (<tt>Thyra::ProductMultiVectorBase</tt>).  Various interfaces to
<em>decorator</em> and <em>composite</em> linear operators are also contained here
and include, for example, <tt>Thyra::ScaledAdjointLinearOpBase</tt>.

  <ul>

  <li> <b>Interfaces to product vector spaces, vectors and multi-vectors</b>
  
    <ul>

    <li><tt>Thyra::ProductVectorSpaceBase</tt> defines an interface for a
    composite product vector space composed from one
    or more constituent <tt>Thyra::VectorSpaceBase</tt> objects.

    <li><tt>Thyra::ProductVectorBase</tt> defines an interface for a
    composite product vector composed from one
    or more constituent <tt>Thyra::VectorBase</tt> objects.

    <li><tt>Thyra::ProductMultiVectorBase</tt> defines an interface for a
    composite product multi-vector composed from one
    or more constituent <tt>Thyra::MultiVectorBase</tt> objects.

    </ul>

  <li> <b>Composite and other linear operator base classes:</b>

  Note that below,
  the term "implicit" denotes the fact that the operators are not actually
  formed.  For example, the sum of the implicitly added linear operators is
  never calculated, but the action of these operators on a vector is
  computed correctly as the sum of the action of each individual operator on
  that vector.
  
    <ul>

    <li><tt>Thyra::ScaledAdjointLinearOpBase</tt> is the base class for all
    decorator subclasses that implicitly
    scale and/or transpose a <tt>Thyra::LinearOpBase</tt> object.

    <li><tt>Thyra::ZeroLinearOpBase</tt> defines the interface for a zero
    linear operator.

    <li><tt>Thyra::IdentityLinearOpBase</tt> defines the interface for an
    identity linear operator \f$I\f$.

    <li><tt>Thyra::AddedLinearOpBase</tt> defines the interface for
    implicitly added linear operators.

    <li><tt>Thyra::MultipliedLinearOpBase</tt> defines the interface for
    implicitly added linear operators.

    <li><tt>Thyra::DiagonalLinearOpBase</tt> defines the interface for a
    basic diagonal linear operator.

    <li><tt>Thyra::BlockedLinearOpBase</tt> is a base class for a logically
    blocked <tt>LinearOpBase</tt>.

    <li><tt>Thyra::PhysicallyBlockedLinearOpBase</tt> is a base class for a
    physically blocked <tt>LinearOpBase</tt> object where the blocks can be
    set externally.

    </ul>

  <li> <b>MPI-Specific ANA-based interfaces</b>

     Note: These interfaces are not strictly related to ANAs and therefore
     may not be appropriate to be placed in this collection.  However, they
     are derived for the ANA interfaces and therefore, very weakly, belong
     in this collection of code.

    <ul>

    <li><tt>Thyra::MpiVectorSpaceBase</tt> defines an interface for getting
    information about the partitioning
     of elements to processors in an SPMD program.

    </ul>

  <li> <b>Miscellaneous</b>
  
    <ul>

    <li><tt>Thyra::MultiVectorFileIOBase</tt> is an interface for strategy
    objects that can read and write (multi)vectors
    to and from files in a very abstract way.

    <li><tt>Thyra::MultiVectorRandomizerBase</tt> is an interface for
    strategy objects that can produce random vectors and multi-vectors.

    <li><tt>Teuchos::PolynomialTraits</tt> is a concrete traits class that
    is used in the <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> interface.

    </ul>

  </ul>

</ul>


\subsubsection thyra_interfaces_operator_solve_sec Operator Solve Interfaces

<ul>

  \image html LinearOpWithSolveAndFactory75.jpg

  These are interfaces that provide a high-level
  interface to preconditioners, linear solvers
  (<tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt>), and factories for these (i.e.
  <tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveFactoryBase</tt> and <tt>Thyra::PreconditionerFactoryBase</tt>).
  Below we use the term "forward" to denote the original operator to which a
  solver is associated to distinguish it from the "inverse" operator.

  <ul>
  
  <li><tt>Thyra::PreconditionerBase</tt> defines an interface to left, right,
  split left/right, and otherwise general preconditioners.
  
  <li><tt>Thyra::PreconditionerFactoryBase</tt> defines an interface for
  generating or updating a <tt>Thyra::PreconditionerBase</tt> object given a
  forward <tt>Thyra::LinearOpBase</tt> object.
  
  <li><tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> defines a simple interface for
  performing the inverse linear operator application.
  
  <li><tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveFactoryBase</tt> defines an interface for

    for implicitly defined <tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> objects
    accessible as one or more <tt>Thyra::LinearOpBase</tt> or
    <tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> subblocks.

    <li><tt>Thyra::PhysicallyBlockedLinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> is a base
    class for composite <tt>Thyra::BlockedLinearOpBase</tt> objects
    that are built for constituent <tt>Thyra::LinearOpBase</tt> and
    <tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> objects.

    </ul>
  
  </ul>

</ul>


\subsubsection thyra_interfaces_nonlinear_sec Nonlinear Interfaces

<ul>

  that a <tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> object will accept and is used to pass
  input arguments to an evaluation.

</ul>


\subsection thyra_support_sec Thyra support software and examples


\subsubsection thyra_support_operator_vector_sec Operator/Vector Support

Described here is a fairly large collection of ANA or client support and
adapter support software based on the operator/vector
interfaces.  For example, you will find things such as unit testing classes
(e.g. <tt>Thyra::LinearOpTester</tt>), and concrete product spaces/vectors/multi-vectors
(e.g. <tt>Thyra::DefaultProductVectorSpace</tt>).  Also included is adapter support
and concrete implementations for serial and SPMD (Single Program Multiple Data) space/vector/multi-vector
implementations (e.g. <tt>Thyra::DefaultSpmdVectorSpace</tt>).  Another
category of software is efficient Java-like handle/wrapper classes
(e.g. <tt>Thyra::VectorSpace</tt>, <tt>Thyra::Vector</tt>, and
<tt>Thyra::LinearOperator</tt>) that defines a convenient API for the
development of ANAs using MATLAB-like operator overloading.  Some
examples are also provided, including several for the Conjugate Gradient method and the Power Method.  This
collection of software is really too vast to give a full sense of what it
contains in this short description.


\subsubsection thyra_support_operator_solve_sec Operator Solve Support

This collection contains support software for the operator/solve interfaces.
Examples include testing software like <tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveTester</tt>
and <em>decorator</em> subclasses like
<tt>Thyra::DefaultDiagonalLinearOpWithSolve</tt>.


\subsubsection thyra_support_nonlinear_model_evaluator_sec Nonlinear Model Evaluator Support

This includes support software for the nonlinear model evaluator interfaces.
Examples include <tt>decorator</tt> subclasses like
<tt>Thyra::DefaultFiniteDifferenceModelEvaluator</tt>.


\subsubsection thyra_support_nonlinear_solvers_sec Nonlinear Solvers Support

Contained here is support software for the nonlinear solver interfaces and
some simple concrete implementations.  Simple concrete nonlinear equation
solver implementations include examples <tt>Thyra::LinearNonlinearSolver</tt>
and <tt>Thyra::DampenedNewtonNonlinearSolver</tt>.


\subsection thyra_adapters_sec Thyra adapters to other packages


\subsubsection thyra_adapters_epetra_sec Epetra/Thyra adapters

This software allows the creation/conversion of Thyra objects and Epetra
objects.  Examples include <tt>Thyra::EpetraLinearOp</tt>,
<tt>Thyra::EpetraVector</tt>, <tt>Thyra::EpetraMultiVector</tt>, and
<tt>Thyra::EpetraVectorSpace</tt>.


\subsubsection thyra_adapters_epetraext_sec EpetraExt/Thyra adapters

Included here are various adapters between Epetra and EpetraExt based code and
Thyra interfaces.  For example, one will find the
<tt>Thyra::EpetraModelEvaluator</tt> class in this collection of code.


\subsection thyra_browse_sec Browse all of Thyra as a single doxygen collection

You can browse all of %Thyra as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning: This is not the recommended way to learn
about %Thyra software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of thyra</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.


\section thyra_software_technicalities_sec Some Technicalities about Thyra Software

A few things about the software in the %Thyra package are worth mentioning:

<ul>

<li><b>Scalar and Ordinal (Ordinal) data types</b>

All of the interfaces are templated on a <b><tt>Scalar</tt></b> (i.e.
floating-point) type and therefore almost all of %Thyra supports arbitrary
scalar types such as complex types (e.g. <tt>std::complex<double></tt>),
automatic differentiation types, interval types and extended precision types
(i.e. <tt>mpf_class</tt>) in addition to simpler real types such as
<tt>double</tt> and <tt>float</tt>.  The only requirement for the
<tt>Scalar</tt> data type is that it have value semantics (i.e. default
constructor, copy constructor, assignment operators) and define the basic
overloaded operators <tt>operator+(...)</tt>, <tt>operator-(...)</tt>,
<tt>operator*(...)</tt> and <tt>operator/(...)</tt>.  The traits class
<tt>Teuchos::ScalarTraits</tt> provides a means to write <em>type-independent</em> 
code and all of the %Thyra software uses this traits class.
Any scalar type that is to be used as a <tt>Scalar</tt> must provide a
specialization of this traits class (see source code for
<tt>Teuchos_ScalarTraits.hpp</tt> for examples of how to do this).  In
addition, if SPMD distributed-memory computing is to be used then
specializations of the traits class <tt>Teuchos::SerializationTraits</tt> must
also be provided.

The %Thyra interfaces and related software are not templated on an index
(i.e. ordinal) type.  Instead, the type <tt>Thyra::Ordinal</tt> is used which is
just a typedef that is defined at configure time to be an integer type of
sufficient size.  This type must be able to hold the value of the largest
dimension of a vector space that will be used by an executable.  For most
platforms and use cases, <b><tt>int</tt></b> is sufficient, but in other cases, 
for example on some 64 bit platforms,
<b><tt>long int</tt></b> may be necessary.  Not
templating on the index (ordinal) type does not result in any degradation in
usability, runtime speed, or storage usage for any use case.  However, certain
types of subclasses of the %Thyra interfaces, such as sparse matrix
subclasses, may need to be templated on a local index (ordinal) type.

<li><b>Dynamic memory management</b>

All of the code in the %Thyra and related packages almost exclusively use the
<tt>%Teuchos</tt> smart reference counted pointer class
<tt>Teuchos::RCP</tt> to handle dynamically allocated memory with
object-oriented programming.  %Thyra also rigorously uses the idioms described
in <a
href="../../../teuchos/doc/html/RefCountPtrBeginnersGuideSAND.pdf">this
report</a> for passing object to and from functions that involve
<tt>Teuchos::RCP</tt>.

<li><b>Error (exception) handling</b>

All error and general exception handling in the %Thyra interfaces and related
software is performed using the built-in C++ exception handling mechanisms
(i.e. <tt>try</tt>, <tt>throw</tt> and <tt>catch</tt>) and all thrown
exceptions should inherit from the standard base class
<tt>std::exception</tt>.  All exceptions in %Thyra software are thrown using
the macros <tt>TEST_FOR_EXCEPTION()</tt> or <tt>TEST_FOR_EXCEPT()</tt>.  By
consistently using these macros it is easy to set a breakpoint in a debugger
just before an exception is thrown by setting a breakpoint on the function
<tt>TestForException_break()</tt> (e.g. by typing <tt>break
TestForException_break</tt> in gdb).  If Trilinos is configured with
<tt>Trilinos_ENABLE_DEBUG=ON</tt> then a lot of runtime error checking is
performed in %Thyra support software, as well as in many other software
packages.  Whenever development work is being performed this option should
always be enabled since a lot of errors will be caught that would be hard to
diagnose otherwise.  Significant effort has gone into developing this error
checking code and in the information that is embedded in the exception objects
(all derived from <tt>std::exception</tt>) that are thrown when errors are
detected.

</ul>


\section thyra_dependencies_sec Other Trilinos Packages on which Thyra Depends

The %Thyra code described here is dependent on the following Trilinos packages:

<ul>
<li><b><a href="../../../teuchos/doc/html/index.html">teuchos</a></b>: This
package supplies basic utility classes such as <tt>Teuchos::RCP</tt>
and <tt>Teuchos::BLAS</tt> on which %Thyra software depends.
<li><b><a href="../../../rtop/doc/html/index.html">rtop</a></b>: This package
supplies the basic interfaces for vector reduction/transformation operators as
well as support code and a library of pre-written RTOp subclasses.
</ul>


\section thyra_configuration_sec Configuration of the Thyra Package

The %Thyra package is configured using CMake and responds to a number of
options that affect the code that is built and what code is installed.

Some of the more important configuration options are:

<ul>

<li><b><tt>Trilinos_ENABLE_Thyra=ON</tt></b>: Causes the %Thyra package and all of
its dependent packages to be enabled and built.  Without this option,
there will be no %Thyra header files or libraries included in the
installation of Trilinos, i.e., when one runs <tt>make install</tt>.
