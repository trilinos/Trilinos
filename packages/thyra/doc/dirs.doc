The interface code in this directory are critical for achieving
interoperability of numerical software both within Trilinos and outside of
Trilinos.  It is critical that we all adopt this basic interface software if
we are going to get anywhere.

The code in these directory provides high-quality and convienent
implementations and wrappers for the basic interoperability interfaces.  While
this type of software must exist to avoid duplication of effort and for %Thyra
to be usable, it, in no way, determines interoperability.  Therefore,
developers can use or reject any or all of the software that exists in this
directory with no impact on interoperability.

This directory combines any and all support code related to operator

operator/vector objects easier to use but is totally indepenent of any
specific type of vector space, vector, multi-vector, or linear operator
implementation.  For example, none of the code in this directory depends on
the operator_vector/adapter_support code and therefore does not assume a
serial or an SPMD environment.
