Release Notes for Trilinos Package Thyra
----------------------------------------


Trilinos 11.0:
--------------

(*) Dropped deprecated code in Trilinos 10.12 (see general release notes on
dropping deprecated code).


Trilinos 10.0:
--------------


(*) MS Windows support with MS Visual C++:

- Thyra complex support and float support are disabled by default.
The complex-related code just did not work correctly and there was not
time to track down the problem.

- Several of the tests showed excessive diffs for this platform so their
tolerance was loosened.



(*) Partial refactoring of code to use safe memory management classes


Trilinos 10.2:
--------------


(*) Added deprecated warnings.  When using GCC, the g++ compiler will now emit
warning messages when client code uses deprecated types and functions.  The
developer of the client code should change over to use non-deprecated code
because the deprecated code will be removed when Trilinos 11.0 is put out.


(*) Deprecated the use of all raw C++ pointers.  All use of raw C++ pointers
is now deprecated in all functions and classes.  For the most part, if a raw
pointer was being used in function foo( ..., T*, ... ) the new function
prototype is foo( ..., const Ptr<T>&, ... ).  A good way to convert from a raw
C++ reference T& to an Ptr<T> object is to use Teuchos::outArg(...) or
Teuchos::inOutArg(...) depending on the nature of the argument.  To convert
from a RCP<T> to a Ptr<T> use the function RCP<T>::ptr().


(*) Refactored the Thyra::LinearOp[WithSolve]Base interfaces:

- LinearOpBase: Removed double templating.  Now requires overridding
opSupportedImpl(...) and applyImpl(...).  This is a break in strict bacward
compatibility but making these functions pure virtual was needed to make sure
the interface is implemented correctly.  Interface should be 100% backward
compatible for external clients through depreicated functions.

- LinearOpWithSolve: Removed double templating.  Now requires overridding
solveImpl(...).  Interface should be 100% backward compatible for external
clients through depreicated functions.  Also, the new solve[Impl](...) 
function only takes a single SolveCriteria object and only returns a single
SolveStatus object to simplify usage.

- Removed SingleScalarXXX node classes.  There is not need for these anymore
now that double templating is gone.

- Removed SingleRhsXXX node subclasses.  These classes just make the
intheritance hierarchy deeper without providing a lot of value.

- ExampleTridiag[Serial,Spmd]LinearOp subdclasses refactored to directly
inherit from LinearOpDefaultBase and use the Detached[Spmd]VectorView classes
to get vector data.


(*) Explicit template instantiation: Thyra now fully supports explicit
template instantiation.  This results in code that builds much faster and can
avoid internal compiler error on some platforms.
