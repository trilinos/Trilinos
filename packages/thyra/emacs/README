A) Introduction to (X)Emacs C++ styles

Here is defined an (x)emacs style for the recommended Thyra coding style in
the ./elisp/cpp-thyra-styles.el file.  This coding style is largely based on
the recommendations in the book "Code Complete", 2nd edition by Steve
MConnell.  Using this style from within emacs will help to provide consistency
in the development of Thyra.

In addition to the "thyra" style, there are a number of named styles that can
be added to the cpp-thyra-styles.el file.  To make a source file automatically
use a specific named style, just put the following line at the top of each
such C/C++ file:

  // -*- c-file-style: "thyra" -*-

By adding new named styles and including a single line that specifies the
style, multiple developers can successfully edit each other's files and use a
consistent indentation style with little trouble.

You can also set a named style manually by using, for example:

  M-x [return] c-set-stype [return] thyra

Note that if you press the tab key after the second [return], emacs will
automatically print out the list of the defined named styles, including those
added by the thyra styles package.

To copy just the file cpp-thyra-styles.el to the directory $HOME/elisp, use
the script:

  ./copy-emacs-thyra-styles.sh

To import the styles into your emacs initialization file, just add the lines:

  ;; Load custom Thyra C++ styles
  (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp/"))
  (require 'cpp-thyra-styles)

To use the "thyra" style as your default style, include the following in your
emacs initialization file:

  ;; Set my style to the Thyra style!
  (setq c-set-style "thyra")

If you want to just copy a pre-setup .emacs file that uses this style by
default, use the script:

  ./copy-emacs-init-file.sh

and it will copy the following files:

 $HOME
   |
   |-- .emacs
   |
   \-- elisp
         |
         \-- cpp-thyra-styles.el

Note that it will overwrite any $HOME/.emacs file that you might already have
so you might want to move it out of the way before you run this script, just
in case.

B) Problems with using customized C++ styles

If one looks at the ./elisp/cpp-thyra-styles.el file one will see that a style
is only added when the editor enters 'cc-mode (i.e. C or C++).  What this
means is that a user-defined style is not added until a C/C++ file is actually
opened.  Therefore, this means that one can not simply set the style in one's
.emacs file using 'c-default-style'.

C) GTags

The program GNU Global tags is a replacement for ctags and etags which is
still under active development.

1) Install the program run:

  $ cd SOME_BASE_DIR
  $ tar -xzvf THIS_DIR/gnu-global-5.7.7.tar.gz
  $ cd global-5.7.7
  $ ./configure && make
  $ sudo make install
  
2) Set up (X)Emacs for using gtags, you must set up your ~/.emacs file with:

;;; Load GNU global
;;;(require 'gtags)
(autoload 'gtags-mode "gtags" "" t)
(setq c-mode-hook
          '(lambda ()
              (gtags-mode 1)
      ))

3) Create (or update) the GTAGS database do:

  $ cd Trilinos
  $ gtags

4) Using gtags from (X)Emacs:

If you are not already in gtags mode run M-x gtags-mode.

You can see all the gtags commands by running M-x gtags-[TAB]

5) Using gtags from the command-line

The program 'global' can be used to search for tags in source code very
quickly.  You must be in the base directory of the source code to run
'global'.

a) Find all files where symbol is initially defined

  $ global -e SYMBOL

b) Find all files that use a symbol

  $ global -se SYMBOL

c) Find all symbols that match a regular expression

  $ global -ce PARTIAL_SYMBOL
