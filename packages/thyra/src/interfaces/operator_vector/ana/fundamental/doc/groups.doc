/** \defgroup Thyra_Op_Vec_Behavior_Of_Views_grp State behavior of Thyra views

All views in Thyra have the behavior as outlined in the below diagram:

\image html StateBehaviorOfViews.gif "State Behavior of Thyra Views (UML State Diagram)"

The above state behavior allows for straightforward implementations of both
"direct" and "detached" views of data from the parent object.  In general, the
state behavior of these views is based on overlapping views.  I is usually
okay to allow multiple mutable views to be active if these views do not
overlap.
