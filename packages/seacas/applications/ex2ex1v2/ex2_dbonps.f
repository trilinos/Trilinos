C   --*** DBONPS *** (EXOLIB) Write database node sets
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/27/86
C   --
C   --DBONPS writes the node set information to the database.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NDB - IN - the database file
C   --   NUMNPS - IN - the number of node sets
C   --   LNPSNL - IN - the length of the node sets node list
C   --   IDNPS - IN - the node set ID for each set
C   --   NNNPS - IN - the number of nodes for each set
C   --   IXNNPS - IN - the index of the first node for each set
C   --   LTNNPS - IN - the nodes for all sets
C   --   FACNPS - IN - the distribution factors for all sets
C   --
C   --Database must be positioned at start of node set information
C   --upon entry; upon exit at end of node set information.
