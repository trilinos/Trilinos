C   --*** DBOESS *** (EXOLIB) Write database node sets
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/27/86
C   --
C   --DBOESS writes the side set information to the database.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NDB - IN - the database file
C   --   NUMESS - IN - the number of side sets
C   --   LESSEL - IN - the length of the side sets element list
C   --   LESSNL - IN - the length of the side sets node list
C   --   IDESS - IN - the side set ID for each set
C   --   NEESS - IN - the number of elements for each set
C   --   NNESS - IN - the number of nodes for each set
C   --   IXEESS - IN - the index of the first element for each set
C   --   IXNESS - IN - the index of the first node for each set
C   --   LTEESS - IN - the elements for all sets
C   --   LTNESS - IN - the nodes for all sets
C   --   FACESS - IN - the distribution factors for all sets
C   --
C   --Database must be positioned at start of side set information
C   --upon entry; upon exit at end of side set information.
