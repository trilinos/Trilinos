C   --ORDSTR orders a list of strings according to a list of indices.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NORD - IN - the number of indices
C   --   IXORD - IN - the indices of the ordered items
C   --   LOLD - IN - the length of NAME
C   --   NAME - IN - the unordered string list
C   --   ISCR - SCRATCH - size = LOLD
C   --   INEW - OUT - the ordered string list

      INTEGER IXORD(*)
      CHARACTER*(*) NAME(*)
      CHARACTER*(*) ISCR(*)

      DO 100 I = 1, LOLD
         ISCR(I) = NAME(I)
  100 CONTINUE
      DO 110 I = 1, NORD
         NAME(I) = ISCR(IXORD(I))
  110 CONTINUE
