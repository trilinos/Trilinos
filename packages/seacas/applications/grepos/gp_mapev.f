      subroutine mapev(nold, nnew, nvar, map, vars, scr)
C=======================================================================
C   --*** MAPVAR *** (GREPOS) Map values from old array to new.
C   --
C   --MAPVAR reorders the data in VARS based on the map in MAP
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NOLD - IN - number of old values, 
C   --   NNEW - IN - number of new values
C   --   NVAR - IN - the number of variables
C   --   NVARDM - IN - the row dimension of VARNP
C   --   MAP  - IN - map from new value to old MAP(NEW) = OLD
C                    size is 'nnew'      
C   --   VARS - IN/OUT - the values. On input in old order,
C                        on output in new order      
C   --   SCR  - TMP - temporary storage area

      
      integer map(*)
      real vars(*)
c      real vars(nold, nvar)
      real scr(*)

C ... VARS is treated as a doubly-dimensioned array (NOLD, NVAR),
C     on input and (NNEW, NVAR) on output.
C     The dimensions need to be in this order so we can read them
C     in using exgev and exgnv. Note that dbist2 ensures that there
C     are values for all elements for each variable even if the
C     variable does not exist for a particular block.  This makes it
C     easier to transfer variables from old to new. We don't need to
C     worry about the truth table in this routine; just transfer
C     all variables from old to new and the output takes care
C     of truth table handling.  This is a little extra work
C     done in this routine, but permits modifying truth table or 
C     combining element blocks with different truth tables.

      do 30 ivar = 1, nvar
        do 10 i = 1, nnew
          scr(i) = vars(map(i) + nold * (ivar-1))
 10     continue
        
        do 20 i = 1, nnew
          vars(i + nnew * (ivar-1)) = scr(i)
 20     continue
 30   continue

      return
      end
