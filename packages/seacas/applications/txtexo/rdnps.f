C   --*** RDNPS *** (TXTEXO) Read database node sets
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/27/86
C   --
C   --RDNPS reads the node set information from the text file.
C   --An error message is displayed if the end of file is read.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NTXT - IN - the text file
C   --   NUMNPS - IN - the number of node sets
C   --   LNPSNL - IN - the length of the node sets node list
C   --   IDNPS - OUT - the node set ID for each set
C   --   NNNPS - OUT - the number of nodes for each set
C   --   IXNNPS - OUT - the index of the first node for each set
C   --   LSTNPS - OUT - the nodes for all sets
C   --   FACNPS - OUT - the distribution factors for all sets
C   --   * - return statement if end of file or read error
C   --
C   --Database must be positioned at start of node set information
C   --upon entry; upon exit at end of node set information.
