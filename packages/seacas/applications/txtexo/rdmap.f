C Changes to read text file generated by exotxt2 after this change:
C
C Shortened text file a little bit. If the element maps are simple
C sequences (1..number_entries), the map is not written and instead the
C text 'sequence 1..numel' or 'sequence 1..numnp' is written. If not a
C simple sequence, then the text 'explicit map' is written followed by
C the map entries on the next line.

C   --*** RDMAP *** (TXTEXO) Read database element order map
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/27/86
C   --
C   --RDMAP reads the element order map, node number map, and element
C     number maps from the text file.  An error
C   --message is displayed if the end of file is read.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NTXT - IN - the text file
C   --   NUM - IN - the number of elements or nodes
C   --   MAP - OUT - the map
C   --   * - return statement if end of file or read error
C   --
C   --Database must be positioned at start of map upon entry;
C   --upon exit at end of map.
