C   --*** RDELB *** (TXTEXO) Read database element block
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/27/86
C   --
C   --RDELB reads the element block information from the text file.
C   --Some dynamic dimensioning is done.
C   --An error message is displayed if the end of file is read.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NTXT - IN - the text file
C   --   IELB - IN - the element block number
C   --   IDELB - IN - the id for this block
C   --   NUMELB - IN - the number of elements in this block
C   --   NUMLNK - IN - the number of nodes per element in this block
C   --   NUMATR - IN - the number of attributes in this block
C   --   A - IN - the dynamic memory base array
C   --   KLINK - IN - pointer to the element connectivity for this block
C   --   KATRIB - IN - pointer to the attributes for this block
C   --   * - return statement if end of file or read error
C   --
C   --Database must be positioned at start of element block information
C   --upon entry; upon exit at end of element block information.
