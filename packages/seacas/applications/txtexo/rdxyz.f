C   --*** RDXYZ *** (TXTEXO) Read database coordinates
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/27/86
C   --
C   --RDXYZ reads the coordinate array from the text file.  An error
C   --message is displayed if the end of file is read.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NTXT - IN - the text file
C   --   NDIM - IN - the number of coordinates per node
C   --   NUMNP - IN - the number of nodes
C   --   XN, YN, ZN - OUT - the coordinates
C   --   * - return statement if end of file or read error
C   --
C   --Database must be positioned at start of coordinates upon entry;
C   --upon exit at end of coordinates.
