C Revision 1.2  1999/06/17 19:02:22  gdsjaar
C Fixed several problems related to holes.  In several places, a
C nonpositive integer was being used to index into an array.  This seems
C to fix all of those cases.  I'm not sure if I fixed the true cause of
C these errors or just the symptom though...
