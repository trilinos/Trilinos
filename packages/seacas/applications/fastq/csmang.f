      SUBROUTINE CSMANG (N, X, Y, ANGLE, NSANG, SMANG, INDEX)
C***********************************************************************
C
C  SUBROUTINE CSMANG = CALCULATES THE "NSANG" SMALLEST ANGLES
C                      AND PLACES THEM IN THE SMANG ARRAY WITH
C                      THE INDICES BEING PLACED IN THE INDEX ARRAY
C
C***********************************************************************
C
C     OBSERVATION: - IT DOES NOT MATTER THE ANGLE ORIENTATION.
C                  - THE ANGLES ARE STORE IN THE ANGLE ARRAY AS THEY
C                    APPEAR.
C                  - THE SMALLEST ANGLES ARE IN ASCENDING ORDER.
C                - THE INDEX ARRAY RETURNS THE SMALLEST ANGLE POSITION
C                    IN ASCENDING ORDER.
