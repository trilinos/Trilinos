C
C  SUBROUTINE APALSM = AREA PULL AND LAPLACIAN MESH SMOOTHER
C
C***********************************************************************
C
C  NOTE:
C     IN THIS SMOOTHER EACH NODE IS SUCCESSIVELY MOVED BY
C     AN AMOUNT GIVEN AS A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF AN *AREA PULL*
C     VECTOR AND THE LAPLACIAN VECTOR (AVERAGE OF VECTORS POINTING
C     TO NEIGHBORS).  THE *AREA PULL* VECTOR IS OBTAINED BY LETTING
C     EACH ELEMENT PULL IN PERPENDICULARLY ON ITS SIDES WITH FORCE
C     PROPORTIONAL TO THE LENGTH OF THAT SIDE TIMES A FACTOR
C     INVOLVING THE AREAS OF THIS ELEMENT AND ITS NEIGHBOR SHARING
C     THAT SIDE.
C
C***********************************************************************
C
C  VARIABLES USED:
C     NIT   = MAX ITERATIONS TO DO
C     TOL   = PERCENT OF SMALLEST CONNECTING LINE TO USE AS NODE MOVEMENT
C             CONVERGENCE TOLERANCE.
C     RO    = UNDER OR OVER-RELAXATION FACTOR.
C     ALPHA = WEIGHT GIVEN TO AREA PULL VECTOR.  USUALLY = 0.5.
C             WEIGHT GIVEN TO LAPLACIAN VECTOR = 1.-ALPHA.
