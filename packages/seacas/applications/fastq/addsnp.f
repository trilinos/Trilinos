C  VARIABLES USED:
C     MSNAP  = DIMENSION OV SNAP ARRAYS
C     SNAPDX = THE SNAP GRID VALUES ARRAY (X AND Y)
C     NSNAP  = THE NUMBER OF SNAP GRID VALUES IN X AND Y
C     INDEX  = 1 FOR X VALUES, 2 FOR Y VALUES
C     VALUE  = THE GRID VALUE TO BE ADDED
C     KOUNT  = THE LOCATION OF THE SNAPDX VALUE JUST LESS THAN VALUE
