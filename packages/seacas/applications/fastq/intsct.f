C                      INTERSECTS THE LINE FROM N3 TO N4

C  NOTE:  THIS INTERSECTION ROUTINE IS BASED ON AN ALGORITHM GIVEN

C  SET UP THE FIRST LINE'S VECTORS (A AND B)

C  SET UP THE SECOND LINE'S VECTORS (C AND D)
C

C
C  NOW USE THE VECTORS AND SOLVE FOR W.
C  W IS THE PROPORTION OF THE DISTANCE ALONG THE VECTOR D
C  WHERE THE INTERSECTION OCCURS.  LIKEWISE U IS THE PROPORTIONAL
C  DISTANCE ALONG THE VECTOR B FOR THE INTERSECTION.   IF THERE IS
C  AN INTERSECTION, BOTH U AND W MUST BE BETWEEN 0 AND 1.
C
      DENOM = (YB * XD) - (XB * YD)
C
C  CHECK FOR SPECIAL PARALLEL CASE - THE DENOMINATOR IS EQUAL TO ZERO.

C
C  W INDICATES AN INTERSECTION HAS OCCURRED.
C  GET THE U VALUE AND CONFIRM.
