C Removed several unused variables from getang subroutine.
C
C Initialized a variable

C Revision 1.2  2004/01/22 14:25:22  gdsjaar
C Attempt to fix strange problem on x86_64 AMD Opteron system using
C Portland Group 5.1-3 compilers. The getang function would work
C correctly if compiled with no optimization and in debug mode, but
C would crash if compiled optimized. The location of the crash was not
C in a place that made any sense that something was wrong.
C
C After much trial and error, it was found that adding a 'SAVE'
C statement at the beginning of the file fixed the problem.
C
C Also cleaned out some unused parameters being passed to the function.
