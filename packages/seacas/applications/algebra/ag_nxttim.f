C   --*** NXTTIM *** (ALGEBRA) Move current time variables to last time
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 12/10/87
C   --
C   --NXTTIM moves the values of the variables for the current time to the
C   --location for the last time.  The move is implemented by swaping
C   --the location pointers for the last and current time.

C   --Parameters:
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Sets ISTVAR of /VAR../
C   --   Uses NUMINP, IXLHS of /VAR../
