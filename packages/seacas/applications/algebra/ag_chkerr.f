C     Modified 9/13/95 for EXODUSIIV2 API calls
C
C     This subroutine should be called after an EXODUSIIV2 subroutine has
C     been invoked.  The arguments of this subroutine are as follows:
C     routine - IN - The exodusIIv2 subroutine
C     caller  - IN - The subroutine invoking the exodusII call
C     ierr    - IN - The error code returned from the exodusII call
C     

      include 'exodusII.inc'

      character*6 routine
      CHARACTER*8 caller
      character*(512) string, path, msg
