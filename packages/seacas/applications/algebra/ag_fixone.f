      SUBROUTINE FIXONE (MAXNE, VARVAL)
C=======================================================================

C   --*** FIXONE *** (ALGEBRA) Handle first time step variables
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 12/10/87
C   --
C   --FIXONE is called after the first time step is read in.  It copies
C   --the current variables to the last and first time step variables
C   --(if needed).  It also corrects the current variable pointer if
C   --only the first time step for a variable is needed.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   MAXNE  - IN     - the VARVAL dimension
C   --   VARVAL - IN/OUT - the input data and copied data
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses ISTVAR of /VAR../
C   --   Uses NVARNP, NVAREL of /DBNUMS/
