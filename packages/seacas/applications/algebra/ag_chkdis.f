      SUBROUTINE CHKDIS (NDIM, NAMECO, NVARNP, NAMENV, LN1, LN2)
C=======================================================================

C   --*** CHKDIS *** (ALGEBRA) Check displacement variables
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 03/02/88
C   --
C   --CHKDIS finds the displacement variables.  The first two/three nodal
C   --variables are displacement variables if and only if they begin with
C   --'D' and end with the last character of the corresponding coordinate
C   --name.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NDIM   - IN - the number of coordinates
C   --   NAMECO - IN - the coordinate names
C   --   NVARNP - IN - the number of nodal variables
C   --   NAMENV - IN - the nodal variable names
