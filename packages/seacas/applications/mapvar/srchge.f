C DESCRIPTION:
C
C  PERFORM A BINARY SEARCH TO FIND THE ELEMENT NUMBER I
C  OF A SORTED ARRAY FOR WHICH ALL ELEMENTS AT I OR ABOVE ARE
C  GREATER OR EQUAL TO THAN SOME VALUE XV,
C  WHILE ALL ELEMENTS BELOW I ARE LESS THAN THE VALUE.

C
C  ASSUMED THAT THE ARRAY X HAS BEEN SORTED IN INCREASING ORDER,
C  BUT THE ELEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN MOVED.
C  THE SORTED LIST IS DETERMINED BY THE ARRAY INDX,
C  WHICH POSITIONS THE ORIGINAL UNSORTED X ARRAY ELEMENTS
C  IN THE SORTED LIST. THUS, THE 5TH ELEMENT IN THE SORTED LIST IS
C    X(IND(5))

C  X      -  ARRAY IN UNSORTED ORDER
C  IND    -  INDEX ARRAY GIVING THE ELEMENT ORDER IN THE SORTED LIST

C  IMIN   -  THE LOWEST NUMBERED POSITION IN THE SORTED LIST TO TEST
C  IMAX   -  THE HIGHEST NUMBERED POSITION IN THE SORTED LIST TO TEST
