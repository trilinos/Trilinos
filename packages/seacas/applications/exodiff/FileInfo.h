/*! \class FileInfo
 *  \author Greg Sjaardema
 *  \brief  Return information about the specified file.
 *
 *  A very minimal class (at least it used to be) for providing
 *  information about a file.  FileInfo provides information about a
 *  file's name, path, and type (directory, symbolic link, file).  Other
 *  information could be added as needed.  It currently does not cache
 *  any information, so if it is heavily used, a caching capability
 *  should be added.  See the Qt Toolkit QFileInfo class for a richer
 *  file class.
