C
c..Dynamic dimensioning of block names+other changes
c..compress output of distribution factors
c..Fix nodal variable read
c..Fix coordinate print (transposed array bounds)
c..Fix mismatch between ss nodes and dist factors
c..Fix printing of global variables
c..fix when no distribution factors on ns or ss
c..Add node number map and change element map to element number map
c..Fix map-check to work with non-permutation maps (id can be greater than numel/numnp)
c  Add check of node map also.  Added indexx to do indexed sort.
c..Minor typo in ckess (nodes -> faces)
c..Add limits, node in connectivity check, and select nodes nodeset
c..Add node and element selection based on nodesets and sidesets
c..Add output of global ids using node and element maps
c..Widen node number output field for disconnected nodes
c..Reorder connectivity check to avoid out-of-bounds array access.
c..Fix Z component of limits output.
c..One more try on limits fix.
c..when global ids output, show message. Turn of warning for no node/el map
c..Split range check into zero and out-of-range checks
c..Make printing of database metadata happen faster
c..Add invers connectivity (invcon) function
c..Add more error checking; fix map error checking

c..Check for unique sideset/nodeset ids
c..limit number of errors printed during check; default 10; set with maxerrs command
c..Add list globnod and list globelem
c..Fixes for reading databases with zero nodes and/or elements
c..Unconnected node message shows local and global id.
c..Added message if running executable instead of script
c..Add precision command for controlling output precision
c..Fix numstr, add error checking for precision command
c..Fix output of element variables to have same number on each line
c..Row/Column on evar output; select evar remove added

c..Fix attribute name check
c..Add option to rename output file, can change during run.  OUTPUT command
c..Add better local/global id specification in list element
c..Can still output maps even with -map or -nomap options.
c..Fix invcon output with mapped element ids
c..Change name to `explore`
c..Fix minmax to work more than once
c..Work with experimental exodus (transient data only)
