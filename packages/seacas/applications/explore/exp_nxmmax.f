C   --*** NXMMAX *** (EXPLORE) Find the min/max for this time step
C   --
C   --NXMMAX finds an incremental minimum and maximum of a variable
C   --for this time step.  It does not reset the min/max if not on the
C   --first step.  It may find the min/max that are greater/less than
C   --the previous values.

C   --Parameters:
C   --   ISTEP - IN - the current step number, previous XMIN and XMAX
C   --      are overwritten if <=1
C   --   MMNUM - IN - number of sequential min/max requests for this
C   --      variable, if >1 then find next min/max
C   --   IVAR - IN - min/max variable number
C   --   NUM - IN - the number of nodes or elements or 1 for global
C   --   VAR - IN - the variables for current time step
C   --   OLDMIN, OLDMAX - IN/OUT - the last minimum and maximum values,
C   --      only if MMNUM > 1
C   --   XMIN, XMAX - IN/OUT - the minimum and maximum values
C   --   MINSTE, MAXSTE - IN/OUT - the step number where the minimum and
C   --      maximum were found
C   --   MINNE, MAXNE - IN/OUT - the node or element number where the
C   --      minimum and maximum were found
C   --   NMIN, NMAX - IN/OUT - the number of values equal to the minimum
C   --      and maximum were found
