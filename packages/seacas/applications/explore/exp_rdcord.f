      SUBROUTINE RDCORD (NDB, NDIM, NUMNP, CORD, NAMECO, ISEOF, NAMLEN)
C=======================================================================

C   --*** RDCORD *** (EXPLORE) Read database coordinates
C   --
C   --RDCORD reads the coordinate array from the database.  An error
C   --message is displayed if the end of file is read.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NDB - IN - the database file
C   --   NDIM - IN - the number of coordinates per node
C   --   NUMNP - IN - the number of nodes
C   --   CORD - OUT - the coordinates
C   --   ISEOF - IN/OUT - set true if end of file read
C   --
C   --Database must be positioned at start of coordinates upon entry;
C   --upon exit at end of coordinates.
