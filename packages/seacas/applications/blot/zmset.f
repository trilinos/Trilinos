C   --*** ZMSET *** (MESH) Delete partial lines outside zoom window
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/02/86
C   --
C   --ZMSET deletes partial lines with both nodes outside the zoom window,
C   --and the line not crossing the zoom window.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   XZMMIN, XZMMAX, YZMMIN, YZMMAX - IN - the box enclosing the
C   --      zoom window
C   --   XN, YN - IN - the nodal coordinates
C   --   LINSET - IN/OUT - the sorted line set
C   --   IPSET - IN/OUT - the indices of the partial line set
C   --   NPART - IN/OUT - the number of lines in the partial line set
