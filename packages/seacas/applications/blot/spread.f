C   --*** SPREAD *** (SPLOT) Read plot variables from database
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/02/88
C   --
C   --SPREAD reads the database and stores all variables needed
C   --for all time steps.
C   --
C   --This routine manipulates dynamic memory, so check after return.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   A - IN - the dynamic memory base array
C   --   NPTIMS - IN - the number of selected times
C   --   IPTIMS - IN - the selected time steps
C   --   NENUM - IN - the selected node/element numbers
C   --   PLTVAL - OUT - the plot variable values
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NDIM, NUMNP, NUMEL, NELBLK,
C   --      NVARHI, NVARGL, NVARNP, NVAREL of /DBNUMS/
C   --   Uses NODVAR, NNENUM of /SELNE/
C   --   Uses NSPVAR of /SPVARS/
