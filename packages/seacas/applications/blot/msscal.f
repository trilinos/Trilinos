C Added optional 'alive value' to the death on variable command.  The
C default value is 0.0, but you can now specify a different value to
C indicate aliveness (for example, the presto DEATH_DUMMY_VAR treats 1.0
C as the alive value).

C Example: DEATH ON DEATH_DUMMY_VAR 1

      SUBROUTINE MSSCAL (DOSCAL, NNPSEL, NPSEL, XN, YN, ZN)
C=======================================================================

C   --*** MSSCAL *** (MESH) Set the mesh scale
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 08/31/87
C   --
C   --MSSCAL sets the mesh window from the selected nodes, if requested,
C   --and calls SETUP to calculate the mesh scaling variables.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   DOSCAL - IN - true iff the mesh window limits are to be calculated
C   --   NNPSEL - IN - the number of nodes in the mesh window
C   --   NPSEL - IN - the nodes in the mesh window
C   --   XN, YN, ZN - IN - the nodal coordinates (ZN for 3D only)
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses MSHDEF of /MSHOPT/
C   --   Uses XISSYM, YISSYM, LFTSYM, BOTSYM of /VIEWS/
C   --   Sets and uses ZMMESH of /MSHLIM/
