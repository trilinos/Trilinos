C   --*** TPCHK *** (TPLOT) Check that TPLOT is a valid program to run
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 11/03/87
C   --
C   --TPCHK checks that TPLOT is a valid program.  This is true if
C   --there are history, global, nodal or element variables in the database.
C   --
C   --If the program is valid, a welcome message is printed.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   PRTOK - IN - if true, print error messages and welcome messages,
C   --      if false, check but do not print anything
C   --   OKAY - OUT - true iff the program is valid
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NVARHI, NVARGL, NVARNP, NVAREL, NSTEPS, NSTEPW of /DBNUMS/

      include 'dbnums.blk'
