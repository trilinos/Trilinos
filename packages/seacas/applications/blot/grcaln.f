C   --*** GRCALN *** (GRPLIB) Align software characters
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 06/09/87
C   --
C   --GRCALN pads the text string with blanks to make numbers line up
C   --in software characters.  It is known that all numbers, minus and
C   --period have the same character size.  A space is half that size
C   --and is expanded to two spaces.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   STRING - IN/OUT - the string to be aligned; maximum of 80 characters
C   --      with a maximum of 40 blanks before a number
C   --   LSTR - OUT - the output length of the string
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses ICURDV, SOFTCH of /GRPCOM/

C   --Routines Called:
C   --   LENSTR - (STRLIB) Find string length
