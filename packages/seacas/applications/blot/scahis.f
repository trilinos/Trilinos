C There were several inline dbnums common blocks. Replaced with the
C include so they all have the same size with the added variable types.
C
C Added minor support for nodeset and sideset variables.
C
C It can print the count and the names, but that is all

      SUBROUTINE SCAHIS (A, VAR, WHOTIM,
     &   VALMIN, ISTMIN, VALMAX, ISTMAX)
C=======================================================================

C   --*** SCAHIS *** (BLOT) Scale all history variables
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 04/01/88
C   --
C   --SCAHIS reads the values for the history variables from the database
C   --and finds the minimum and maximum values.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   A - IN - the dynamic memory base array
C   --   VAR - SCRATCH - the variable array
C   --   WHOTIM - IN - true iff time step is a whole (versus history) time step
C   --   VALMIN, VALMAX - OUT - the minimum and maximum value for each variable
C   --   ISTMIN, ISTMAX - OUT - the step number of the minimum and maximum
C   --      value for each variable
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NVARHI, NSTEPS of /DBNUMS/

      include 'dbnums.blk'
