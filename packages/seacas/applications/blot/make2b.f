C   --*** MAKE2B *** (BLOT) Create element to element block index
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 09/08/87
C   --
C   --MAKE2B creates a list of the element block for each element.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NELBLK - IN - the number of element blocks to read
C   --   LENE - IN - the cumulative element counts by element block
C   --   IE2ELB - OUT - the element block for each element
C   --      filled with the element block number, not ID

      INTEGER NELBLK
      INTEGER LENE(0:NELBLK)
      INTEGER IE2ELB(*)

      DO 110 IELB = 1, NELBLK
         DO 100 IEL = LENE(IELB-1)+1, LENE(IELB)
            IE2ELB(IEL) = IELB
  100    CONTINUE
  110 CONTINUE

      RETURN
      END
