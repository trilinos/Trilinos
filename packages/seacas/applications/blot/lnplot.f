C   --*** LNPLOT *** (PATHLN) Plot the pathlines
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 05/27/88
C   --
C   --LNPLOT plots the pathlines.  For 3D meshes, the pathlines are rotated.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NPTIMS - IN - the number of points on a history pathline
C   --   NPTIMW - IN - the number of points on a non-history pathline
C   --   XLN, YLN, ZLN - IN - the pathline data
C   --   IXNODE - SCRATCH - size = NPTIMS (3D only)
C   --   * - return statement if the cancel function is active
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NLNCRV, ILVID of /LNVARS/
C   --   Uses ROTMAT, ROTCEN of /ROTOPT/
