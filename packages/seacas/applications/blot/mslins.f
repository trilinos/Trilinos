C   --*** MSLINS *** (MESH) Create line set from surface faces
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 03/29/88
C   --
C   --MSLINS creates a line set of all lines making up the surface faces.
C   --The lines are classified and sorted into the following parts:
C   --   -1) Edge
C   --    0) Element block boundary
C   --    n) Interior within element block 'n'
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   A - IN - the dynamic memory base array
C   --   LENF - IN - the cumulative face counts by element block
C   --   NLNKF - IN - the number of nodes per face
C   --   LINKF - IN - the connectivity for all surface faces
C   --   IF2EL - IN - the element number of each face
C   --   LENL - OUT - the cumulative line counts by element block
C   --   KLNSET - OUT - the dynamic memory index of sorted line set,
C   --      for surface faces only
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NELBLK of /DBNUMS/
C   --   Uses IS3DIM, NUMNPF of /D3NUMS/
