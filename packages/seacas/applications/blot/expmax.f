C=======================================================================

C   --*** EXPMAX *** (BLOT) Expands min/max values
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/07/87
C   --
C   --EXPMAX expands the minimum and maximum values by 2.5% each.
C   --It also expands the appropriate limit by 2.5% for numbering.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   LABSID - IN - if 'FIRST', expand for numbering on left side;
C   --      if 'LAST', expand for numbering on right side
C   --   VMIN/VMAX - IN/OUT - the minimum and maximum axis values

      CHARACTER*(*) LABSID
      REAL VMIN, VMAX

      IF (VMIN .EQ. VMAX) THEN
         IF (VMIN .EQ. 0.0) THEN
            VMIN = -1.0
            VMAX = 1.0
