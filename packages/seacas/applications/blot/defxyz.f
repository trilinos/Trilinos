C There were several inline dbnums common blocks. Replaced with the
C include so they all have the same size with the added variable types.
C
C Added minor support for nodeset and sideset variables.

C   --*** DEFXYZ *** (MESH) Calculate deformed mesh coordinates
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/12/87
C   --   D. P. Flanagan, 11/17/82
C   --
C   --DEFXYZ calculates the deformed mesh coordinates for a time step.
C   --The displacement variables for the time steps are input and the
C   --deformed mesh coordinates are calculated.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   A - IN - the dynamic memory base array
C   --   ISTEP - IN - the time step number
C   --   FACTOR - IN - the magnification factor
C   --   SURONL - IN - deform NPSURF nodes only if true (always true for 3D)
C   --   XN, YN, ZN - IN - the nodal coordinates (ZN for 3D only)
C   --   NPSURF - IN - the node numbers of the surface nodes
C   --      or mesh boundary nodes (2D)
C   --   DXN, DYN, DZN - OUT - the deformed nodal coordinates
C   --      (DZN for 3D only)
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NDIM of /DBNUMS/
C   --   Uses IS3DIM, NUMNPF of /D3NUMS/
C   --   Sets IXDEF, IYDEF, IZDEF of /DEFORM/
