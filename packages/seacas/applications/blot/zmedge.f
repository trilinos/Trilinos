C   --*** ZMEDGE *** (MESH) Delete edges outside zoom window
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/02/86

C   --ZMEDGE deletes edges with both nodes outside the zoom window,
C   --and the line not crossing the zoom window.

C   --      zoom window

C   --   IEDSET - IN/OUT - the edge line set;
C   --      (0) = face defining edge; 0 to delete edge
C   --   NEDGES - IN - the number of lines in the edge set
