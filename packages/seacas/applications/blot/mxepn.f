C There were several inline dbnums common blocks. Replaced with the
C include so they all have the same size with the added variable types.
C
C Added minor support for nodeset and sideset variables.
C
C It can print the count and the names, but that is all
C at this time.

C Fixed problem with incorrect 'mesh contiguity' errors. Max number of
C faces connected to a node was being based on block-by-block counting
C of elements connected to a node which didn't work well for meshes
C containing lots of blocks. Changed to do count based on all element blocks.

C   --*** MXEPN *** (MESH) Count number of elements per node
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/26/87
C   --
C   --MXEPN counts the maximum number of elements that a node is in.

C   --Parameters:
C   --   NUME - IN - the number of elements

C   --   LINKE - IN - the original connectivity (some nodes may be 0)
C   --   NFPN - SCRATCH - size = 1+NUMNP
