C   --*** GRCOLU *** (GRPLIB) Set color table to use (PLT)

C   --GRCOLU sets the color table to use.

C   --Parameters:
C   --   MAP - IN - the color table map to use:
C   --      'STANDARD'  = standard color map
C   --      'ALTERNATE' = alternate color map (if defined)
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses DEVOK, ICURDV, NUMCOL, MAPALT of /GRPCOM/
C   --   Sets MAPUSE of /GRPCOM/

      COMMON /GRPCOC/ DEVNAM(2), DEVCOD(2)
      CHARACTER*3 DEVNAM
