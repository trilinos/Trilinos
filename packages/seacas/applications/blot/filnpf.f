C   --FILNPF puts a pointer to the given face into each of the face's node
C   --NPFS array.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NLNKF - IN - the number of nodes per face
C   --   LINKF1 - IN - the connectivity for the face
C   --   NFACES - IN - the face number
C   --   MAXNPF - IN - the maximum length of the NPFS entry
C   --   NPFS - IN/OUT - the list of unmatched faces containing a node;
C   --      (0,i) = the length of the list
C   --   NOVER - IN/OUT - the number of overrun errors
