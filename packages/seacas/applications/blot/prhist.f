C   --Parameters:
C   --   OPTION - IN - '*' to print all, else print options
C   --   NOUT - IN - the output file, <=0 for standard
C   --   NVARHI - IN - the number of history variables
C   --   LISHV - IN - the indices of the selected history variables
C   --   NAMEHV - IN - the names of the history variables
C   --   VARHI - IN - the history variables for the time step
