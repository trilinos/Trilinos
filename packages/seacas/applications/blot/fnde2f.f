C There were several inline dbnums common blocks. Replaced with the
C include so they all have the same size with the added variable types.
C
C Added minor support for nodeset and sideset variables.

C   --*** FNDE2F *** (MESH) Find faces that make up element
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 07/06/87
C   --
C   --FNDE2F finds the surface faces that make up the given element.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   IEL - IN - the element number
C   --   LENF - IN - the cumulative face counts by element block
C   --   IF2EL - IN - the element number of each face
C   --   NQARY - IN/OUT - input as the maximum length of the IFACES array;
C   --      output as the length of the IFACES array
C   --   IFACES - OUT - the surface faces that make up the element
C   --   IELB - OUT - the element block of the element quarilaterals
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NDIM, NELBLK of /DBNUMS/

      include 'dbnums.blk'
