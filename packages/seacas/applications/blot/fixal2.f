C There were several inline dbnums common blocks. Replaced with the
C include so they all have the same size with the added variable types.
C
C Added minor support for nodeset and sideset variables.

C   --*** FIXAL2 *** (MESH) Adjust for element birth/death (2D)
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 03/10/88

C   --FIXAL2 adjusts the face array to reflect the new element states.
C   --Faces that are dead are moved to LENF(NELBLK+2).

C   --   LENF - IN - the cumulative face counts by element block

C   --   IE2ELB - IN - the element block for each element
C   --   NEWELB - OUT - size = LENF(NELBLK+1)
