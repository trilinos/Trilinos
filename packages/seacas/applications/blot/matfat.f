C   --*** MATFAT *** (MESH) Match face with existing faces

C .... MODIFIED FOR TRIANGULAR FACES OF TET ELEMENTS....

C   --MATFAT searches for the given face in the list of previously
C   --identified faces.  If a match is found, a pointer to the
C   --matching face is returned.
C   --
C   --The search is done by looking at the list of the faces which
C   --contain each node (the NPFS array).  The lists of two diagonally
C   --opposite nodes in the given face are searched for a reference
C   --to a common face, which is a "match".  The references to the
C   --common face are deleted for all nodes in the face.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   LINKF1 - IN - the nodes of the face
C   --   MAXNPF - IN - the maximum length of the NPFS entry
C   --   NPFS - IN/OUT - the list of unmatched faces containing a node;
C   --      (i,0) = the length of the list
C   --   IEL - IN - the element containing the face (for error message)
C   --   IERR - OUT - = 0 if routine executes with no errors
C   --                = 1 if an error was detected.
