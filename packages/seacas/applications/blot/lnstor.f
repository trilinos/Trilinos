C 1. Problem with TIMES array. Blot accesses a dummy timestep even if
C there were no timesteps on the database. Array wasn't allocated, so
C writing off into never-never land.
C
C 2. Inconsistency among some common blocks. Some places weren't using
C the include but had the definition hardwired in. Removed those.
C
C 3. Added 'EXTERNAL BLKDAT' to all routines that used data values set
C in BLKDAT
C
C 4. Cleanup of some A vs. IA argument passing.

C   --*** LNSTOR *** (PATHLN) Read and store pathline data from database
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 05/27/88
C   --
C   --LNSTOR reads variables from the database and stores any that are
C   --pathline data in the appropriate location.  It reads only one
C   --variable type (history, global, nodal, element) per call.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   A - IN - the dynamic memory base array
C   --   ISTEP - IN - the time step number
C   --   TYP - IN - the type of variable:
C   --      'H'istory, 'G'lobal, 'N'odal, 'E'lement
C   --   NWRDS - IN - the number of words in a data record
C   --   NVAR - IN - the number of records to read
C   --   NPT - IN - the XLN, YLN, ZLN time index to fill
C   --   NPTS - IN - the maximum XLN, YLN, ZLN time index
C   --   XLN, YLN, ZLN - IN/OUT - the pathline data array
C   --   DATA - SCRATCH - size = NWRDS
