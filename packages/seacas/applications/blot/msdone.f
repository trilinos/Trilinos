C   --*** MSDONE *** (MESH) Clean up after mesh plot set
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 05/26/88
C   --
C   --MSDONE cleans up the memory after a mesh plot set.  Many variables
C   --may be needed to do "picks" on the mesh plot.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   ANYDEF - IN - true iff any deformed mesh is to be plotted
C   --   ANYUND - IN - true iff any undeformed mesh is to be plotted
C   --   DOIXF - IN - true iff the IXFAC array is needed
C   --   DON2B - IN - true iff the IN2ELB array is needed
C   --   DOELED - IN - true iff the deformed element quarilateral centers
C   --      are needed
C   --   DOELEU - IN - true iff the undeformed element quarilateral centers
C   --      are needed
C   --   DODEAD - IN - true iff dead nodes are needed
C   --   DONPS - IN - true iff node set information is needed
C   --   DOESS - IN - true iff side set information is needed
