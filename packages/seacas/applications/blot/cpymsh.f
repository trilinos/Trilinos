C   --*** CPYMSH *** (MESH) Copy mesh display parameters from another view
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 04/11/88
C   --
C   --CPYMSH copies the mesh display options from one view to another
C   --view or sets the view to undefined.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   INEW - IN - the view to be set
C   --   IOLD - IN - the view to be copied; <=0 to set to undefined
C   --   ISSNPS - IN/OUT - the indices of the selected node sets
C   --   ISSESS - IN/OUT - the indices of the selected side sets
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NUMNPS, NUMESS of /DBNUMG/
C   --   Sets MSHDEF, MSHNUM, MSHLIN, MLNTYP, NNPSET, NESSET of /MSHOPT/
C   --   Uses MODDET, MODTYP of /DETOPT/
