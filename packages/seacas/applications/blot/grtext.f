C   --*** GRTEXT *** (GRPLIB) Write text (PLT)
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/14/86
C   --
C   --GRTEXT writes a software or hardware character string at a location
C   --(left-justified).
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   DX, DY - IN - the horizontal and vertical string location
C   --      (in device coordinates)
C   --   STRING - IN - the string to be written, may be truncated
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses ICURDV, SOFTCH of /GRPCOM/

C   --Routines Called:
C   --   PLTXTH - (PLTLIB) Display a hardware string
C   --   PLTXTS - (PLTLIB) Display a software string
C   --   LENSTR - (STRLIB) Find string length
