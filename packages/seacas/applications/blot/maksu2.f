C   --*** MAKSU2 *** (MESH) Determine which nodes are on surface (2D)
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 03/10/88
C   --
C   --MAKSU2 calculates the nodes-on-surface indicator (NPSURF).
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   LENL - IN/OUT - the cumulative line counts by element block
C   --   LINSET - IN/OUT - the sorted line set
C   --   MAXMSH - IN - the maximum mesh line types to be displayed
C   --      (as in MSHLIN of /MSHOPT/)
C   --   DODEAD - IN - add in dead nodes from IDN2B iff true
C   --   IDN2B - IN - the element block for each dead node; dead if >= 0
C   --   NPSURF - OUT - the node numbers of the mesh boundary nodes
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NDIM, NELBLK of /DBNUMS/
C   --   Sets NNPSUR, NUMNPF of /D3NUMS/
