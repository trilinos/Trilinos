C There were several inline dbnums common blocks. Replaced with the

C   --*** ALLAL3 *** (MESH) Adjust for elements all alive (3D)
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 03/10/88
C   --
C   --ALLAL3 adjusts the face array to reflect all elements alive.
C   --
C   --An element birth causes all the faces of the element to be moved
C   --as follows:
C   --   Dead    -> surface (if one alive element for face) or
C   --              interior (if two alive elements)
C   --   Surface -> interior
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   LENF - IN - the cumulative face counts by element block
C   --   IF2EL - IN - the element number of each face
C   --   IF2EL2 - IN - the secondary element number of each face
C   --   IE2ELB - IN - the element block for each element
C   --   NEWELB - OUT - size = LENF(NELBLK+1)

C   --Common Variables:
