C   --*** CALDIS *** (SPLOT) Calculate node/element distances
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/14/86
C   --
C   --CALDIS calculates the distances between selected nodes or elements.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NNENUM - IN  - the number of selected node/element numbers
C   --   NENUM  - IN  - the selected node/element numbers
C   --   XNE,
C   --   YNE,
C   --   ZNE    - IN  - the coordinates of the nodes (if nodes)
C   --                  or element centroids (if elements)
C   --   SDISTS - OUT - the calculated distances
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NDIM of /DBNUMS/
