C   --*** SPSTOR *** (SPLOT) Read and store plot variables from database
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 11/05/87
C   --
C   --SPSTOR reads variables from the database and stores any that are
C   --plot variables in the appropriate location.  It reads only one
C   --variable type (nodal or element) per call.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   A - IN - the dynamic memory base array
C   --   ISTEP - IN - the time step number
C   --   TYP - IN - the variable type ("N"odal or "E"lement)
C   --   NWRDS - IN - the number of words in a data record
C   --   NVAR - IN - the number of records to read
C   --   NENUM - IN - the selected node/element numbers
C   --   PLTVAL - OUT - the plot data array
C   --   DATA - SCRATCH - size = NWRDS
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NELBLK, NVAREL of /DBNUMS/
C   --   Uses NNENUM of /SELNE/
C   --   Uses NSPVAR, ISVID of /SPVARS/
