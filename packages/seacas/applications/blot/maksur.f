C There were several inline dbnums common blocks. Replaced with the
C include so they all have the same size with the added variable types.
C
C Added minor support for nodeset and sideset variables.

C   --*** MAKSUR *** (MESH) Determine which nodes are on surface
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 03/10/88
C   --
C   --MAKSUR calculates the nodes-on-surface indicator (NPSURF).
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   LENF - IN - the cumulative face counts by element block
C   --   NLNKF - IN - the number of nodes per face
C   --   LINKF - IN - the connectivity for all faces
C   --   DODEAD - IN - add in dead nodes from IDN2B iff true
C   --   IDN2B - IN - the element block for each dead node; dead if >= 0
C   --   NPSURF - OUT - the node numbers of the surface nodes
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NDIM, NELBLK of /DBNUMS/
C   --   Sets NNPSUR, NUMNPF of /D3NUMS/
