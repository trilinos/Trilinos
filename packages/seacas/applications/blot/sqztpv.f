C   --*** SQZTPV *** (TPLOT) Compress curves for whole time steps
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 11/11/87
C   --
C   --SQZTPV compresses the values for TPLOT curves so that only the values
C   --for whole time steps are in the curve.  Curves of history variables
C   --only are left intact.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NPTIMS - IN - the number of selected time steps
C   --   IPTIMS - IN - the selected time steps
C   --   WHOTIM - IN - true iff whole (versus history) time step
C   --   NPTS - OUT - the number of points on each curve
C   --   PLTVAL - IN/OUT - the plot data;
C   --      PLTVAL(x,NTPVAR+1) holds the times if TIMPLT
C   --      PLTVAL(x,NTPVAR+2) holds the compressed times if TIMPLT and needed
