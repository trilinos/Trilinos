C=======================================================================

C   --*** CNVMAX *** (DETOUR) Calculate nodal variable min/max and count number
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 03/09/88
C   --
C   --CNVMAX calculates the minimum and maximum value of a nodal variable
C   --and counts the number of occurrences of the minimum and maximum.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NUMNPF - IN - the number of nodes
C   --   VARNP - IN - the nodal variable values
C   --   IN2ELB - IN - the element block for each node;
C   --      <0 if not in any selected element block
C   --      =0 if in more than one selected element block
C   --   NMIN, NMAX - OUT - the number of variables values matching the
C   --      minimum and the maximum
C   --   FMIN, FMAX - OUT - the nodal variable minimums and maximums
