C   --*** VEC *** (DETOUR) Plot vector
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 04/16/85
C   --
C   --VEC displays a vector starting at the given coordinates.  The vector
C   --represents the given X, Y, and Z values.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   IS3DIM - IN - true iff 3D versus 2D
C   --   X0, Y0, Z0 - IN - the vector coordinates
C   --   XVAR, YVAR, ZVAR - IN - the vector components
C   --   VECSCL - IN - the vector scale factor
C   --   VWSCL - IN - 1.0 if single view, 0.5 if multiple

      LOGICAL IS3DIM

      LOGICAL EXISTS

      EXISTS (M) = (MOD(M,2) .NE. 0)
