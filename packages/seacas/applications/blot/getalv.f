C There were several inline dbnums common blocks. Replaced with the
C include so they all have the same size with the added variable types.
C
C Added minor support for nodeset and sideset variables.
C
C It can print the count and the names, but that is all
C at this time.

C Revision 1.2  2007/11/14 20:14:53  gdsjaar
C Added optional 'alive value' to the death on variable command.  The
C default value is 0.0, but you can now specify a different value to
C indicate aliveness (for example, the presto DEATH_DUMMY_VAR treats 1.0
C as the alive value).
C
C Example: DEATH ON DEATH_DUMMY_VAR 1

      SUBROUTINE GETALV (A, NALVAR, ALIVAL, ISTEP, LENE, ISEVOK,
     *  ALIVE, VAR)
C=======================================================================

C   --*** GETALV *** (MESH) Read birth/death variable
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/28/87
C   --
C   --GETALV reads the values for the requested birth/death variable and
C   --returns the element state.
C   --
C   --The element is alive iff the input variable is 0.0.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   A - IN - the dynamic memory base array
C   --   NALVAR - IN - the variable sequence number
C   --   ALIVAL - IN - the value to indicate element is fully alive
C   --   ISTEP - IN - the time step number
C   --   LENE - IN - the cumulative element counts by element block
C   --   ISEVOK - IN - the element block variable truth table;
C   --      variable i of block j exists iff ISEVOK(j,i)
C   --   ALIVE - OUT - true iff the element i is alive
C   --   VAR - SCRATCH - the birth/death variable array; may be ALIVE
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NUMEL, NELBLK of /DBNUMS/

      include 'dbnums.blk'
