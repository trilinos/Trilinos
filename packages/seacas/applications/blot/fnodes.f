C   --FNODES returns the nodes for a given face of a hexahedral element.
C   --The 4-tuple sequence defining the face is counter-clockwise looking
C   --into the element.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   IFACE - IN - the face number
C   --   LINKE - IN - the hexahedral element connectivity
C   --   NODEF - OUT - the nodes in the extracted face

      INTEGER LINKE(8), NODEF(4)

      INTEGER KFACE(4,6)
      SAVE KFACE
C      --KFACE(*,i) - the indices of the 4 nodes in face i

      DATA KFACE / 1, 4, 3, 2,  5, 6, 7, 8,
     &   3, 4, 8, 7,  2, 3, 7, 6,  1, 2, 6, 5,  1, 5, 8, 4 /

      DO 100 K = 1, 4
         NODEF(K) = LINKE(KFACE(K,IFACE))
  100 CONTINUE

      RETURN
      END
