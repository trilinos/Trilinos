C   --*** SCAL3D *** (MESH) Find the 2D limits of a 3D mesh
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 06/30/86
C   --
C   --SCAL3D takes the mesh limits and scales them in one of two ways:
C   --   1) it finds the 2D limits enclosing the smallest sphere enclosing
C   --      a cube from the maximum 3D limits
C   --   2) it finds the 2D limits of the rotated mesh
C   --The mesh limits are expanded a little.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   MSCTYP - IN - mesh scaling flag (as in /MSHLIM/)
C   --   ROTMAT - IN - the rotation matrix
C   --   ROTCEN - IN - the mesh center for the rotation
C   --   ALMESH - IN - the mesh limits
C   --   D2MESH - OUT - the 2D rotated mesh limits
