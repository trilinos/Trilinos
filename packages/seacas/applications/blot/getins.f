c ROUTINE:              getins

c DESCRIPTION:          This routine is in charge of getting user
c                       input and keeping track of where
c                       it is coming from.

c
c TYPE OF SUBPROGRAM:   subroutine
c
c USEAGE:               call getins (id, maxfld, nfield,
c                                    kvalue, cvalue, ivalue, rvalue,
c                                    line, iostat, prompt,
c                                    lprom, *)
c
c PARAMETERS:
c
c     character*(*) id  -- (input)
c                        = 'parse' if the input line should be read
c                        and parsed by the free field reader.  If so,
c                        input information is returned in the nfield,
c                        kvalue, cvalue, ivalue, and rvalue parameters.
c                        = 'line' if the input line is to be read as
c                        one line.  If so, the input line is returned
c                        in the parameter line.
c     integer maxfld  -- (input)
c                        Maximum number of fields returned by the
c                        free field reader (frefld).
c     integer nfield  -- (output)
c                        number of data fields returned by
c                        the free field reader (frefld).
c     integer kvalue( maxfld ) -- ( output )
c                        Translation states of the data fields
c                        returned by the free field reader.  The
c                        value of each element of this array is
c                        interpreted as follows:
c                           -1 = This is a null field.
c                            0 = This is a nonnumeric field; only
c                                cvalue contains a specified value.
c                            1 = This is a real numeric field;
c                                cvalue and rvalue contain specified
c                                values.
c                            2 = This is an integer numeric field;
c                                cvalue, rvalue, and ivalue contain
c                                specified values.
c     character*(*) cvalue( maxfld ) -- ( output )
c                         Character values of the data fields returned
c                         by the free field reader (frefld).  The data
c                         will be left justified and either
c                         blank-filled or truncated.  The value in
c                         this array is set by frefld to be blank
c                         for a null field.
c     integer ivalue( maxfld ) -- ( output )
c                         Integer values of the data fields.  The
c                         value in this array is set by frefld to
c                         be zero for a null or non-integer field.
c     real rvalue( maxfld ) -- ( output )
c                         Floating-point values of the data fields.
c                         The value in this array is set by frefld
c                         to be zero for a null or non-real fields.
c     character*(*) line -- ( output )
c                         If id = 'line', then the input line
c                         is returned in this parameter.
c     integer iostat -- (output)
c                         iostat value returned by the frefld reader
c                         (if id = 'parse') or by the read
c                         statement (if id = 'line').
c     character*(*) prompt -- (input)
c                         Prompt to be displayed to user.
c     integer lprom -- (input)
c                         Length of prompt string.

C ... We have a problem on systems with case-sensitive file names.
C     FREFLD converts all strings to uppercase.  Therefore, the filename
C     specified in 'file' will be all uppercase.  Since the file is
C     typically lowercase, we lowercase 'file' in variable 'filelc'.
C     First, try to open 'file' (uppercase), if this fails, try to 
C     open 'filelc' (lowercase).  NOTE: There is no way (yet) to deal
C     with mixed-case filenames.  GDS 7/1/91.
