C   --*** DEFLIM *** (MESH) Calculate deformed mesh limits
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 01/22/88
C   --   D. P. Flanagan, 11/17/82
C   --
C   --DEFLIM calculates the limits of the deformed mesh.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   A        - IN - the dynamic memory base array
C   --   WHOTIM   - IN - true iff whole (versus history) time step
C   --   XN,YN,ZN - IN - the nodal coordinates (ZN for 3D only)
C   --   NPSURF   - IN - the node numbers of the surface nodes
C   --                   or mesh boundary nodes (2D)
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NDIM, NVARNP, NSTEPS of /DBNUMS/
C   --   Uses IS3DIM, NNPSUR, NUMNPF of /D3NUMS/
C   --   Sets DEFOK, DEFFAC, IXDEF, IYDEF, IZDEF of /DEFORM/
C   --   Sets ALMESH of /MSHLIM/
