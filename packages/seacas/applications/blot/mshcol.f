C There were several inline dbnums common blocks. Replaced with the
C include so they all have the same size with the added variable types.
C
C Added minor support for nodeset and sideset variables.
C
C It can print the count and the names, but that is all
C at this time.

C On the 64-bit compile using the portland compiler on reddish; the
C construct "call function(float(intarg))" was passing an invalid value;
C probably due to a 32-bit vs 64-bit confusion.
C
C I changed it to "call function(1.0*intarg)" which performs an implicit
C conversion to real which I guess uses the correct 32-bit vs 64-bit.

C=======================================================================

C   --*** MSHCOL *** (MESH) Set line color, type, and width
C   --   Modified by John Glick - 1/17/89
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 03/29/88
C   --
C   --MSHCOL sets the line color, type, and width.  The lines have been
C   --divided into parts as follows:
C   --   -1) Mesh boundary
C   --    0) Element block boundary
C   --    n) Interior within element block 'n'
C   --
C   --Be sure to call this routine to reset the line type and line width
C   --to the default before exiting the mesh-drawing routine.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   FNCT - IN - the type of lines being drawn:
C   --      'RESET'    - reset line type, etc.
C   --      'INTERIOR' - the interior mesh lines (small)
C   --      'BOUNDARY' - mesh boundaries defined by hidden lines
C   --      'LINE'     - normal mesh lines
C   --      'DEBUG'    - lines for debugging (blue)
C   --   IELB - IN - the line "part" (as above)
C   --   MLNTYP - IN - the line type (and color) of lines (as in /MSHOPT/)
C   --   WIDLIN - IN - true iff mesh lines should be wide versus narrow
C   --   BLKCOL - IN/OUT - the user selected colors of the element blocks.
C   --                    BLKCOL(0) = 1 if the user defined material
C   --                                colors should be used in mesh plots.
C   --                              = -1 if program selected colors should
C   --                                be used.
C   --                    BLKCOL(i) = the user selected color of element
C   --                               block i:
C   --                                  -2 - no color selected by user.
C   --                                  -1 - black
C   --                                   0 - white
C   --                                   1 - red
C   --                                   2 - green
C   --                                   3 - yellow
C   --                                   4 - blue
C   --                                   5 - cyan
C   --                                   6 - magenta
