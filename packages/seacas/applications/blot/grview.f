C   --*** GRVIEW *** (GRPLIB) Set graphics window
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/20/86
C   --
C   --GRVIEW sets the device coordinates for the window given the X:Y
C   --axis length ratio.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   ASPECT - IN - the ratio of the X axis length to the Y axis length
C   --      = (X axis length / Y axis length) {in window units}
C   --      / (X axis length / Y axis length) {in device units}
C   --   DVIEW0 - IN - the maximum window (left, right, bottom, top)
C   --      (in device coordinates)
C   --   DVIEW - OUT - the actual window (left, right, bottom, top)
C   --      (in device coordinates)

      PARAMETER (KLFT=1, KRGT=2, KBOT=3, KTOP=4)

      REAL ASPECT
      REAL DVIEW0(KTOP), DVIEW(KTOP)

         DVIEW(KLFT) = DVIEW0(KLFT) + OS
         DVIEW(KRGT) = DVIEW0(KRGT) - OS
