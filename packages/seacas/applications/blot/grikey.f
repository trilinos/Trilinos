C   --*** GRIKEY *** (GRPLIB) Position cursor and wait for a key (PLT)
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 04/28/88
C   --
C   --GRIKEY positions a cursor and waits until a key is pressed.
C   --A message may be output before the cursor is positioned.  The
C   --cursor position and the key are returned.
C   --
C   --The first time this routine is called, a warning message is output.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   PROMPT - IN - prompt for key if non-blank
C   --   DX, DY - IN/OUT - the device coordinates of cursor
C   --   KEY - OUT - returned key pressed; upper-case
C   --   * - the alternate return if cancel requested or cursor input error

C   --Routines Called:
C   --   PLTCRS - (PLTLIB) Select cursor position
C   --   PLTFLU - (PLTLIB) Flush buffer
C   --   LENSTR - (STRLIB) Find string length
