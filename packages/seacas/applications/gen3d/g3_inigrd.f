C     INIGRD: Initialize array ARRAY with NPTS values.
C             values are calculated to have a gradient of GRAD
C             ranging from FROM to TO with NINT segments.
C
C --- FROM - IN - Minimum value of range
C --- TO   - IN - Maximum value of range
C --- GRAD - IN - Gradient
C --- NINT - IN - Number of intervals in range
C --- NPTS - IN - Number of points in range.  Can be less than NINT if
C                 do not need full range, but want gradient spacing
C                 based on full range.  Normally NPTS = NINT + 1
C --- ARRAY- OUT- Range of values
C
      REAL    ARRAY(NPTS)
