C   --*** USBLK *** (GEN3D) Read list of element block IDs
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 05/21/86
C   --
C   --USBLK processes a list of element block IDs.  If an element block
C   --is in the list, the block type is changed to the new block type.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   IFLD - IN/OUT - the free-field index
C   --   INTYP - IN - the free-field type
C   --   CFIELD - IN - the free-field characters
C   --   IFIELD - IN - the free-field integers
C   --   NEWTYP - IN - the element block type to be set
C   --   NELBLK - IN - the number of element blocks
C   --   IDELB - IN - the ids for each block
C   --   BLKTYP - IN/OUT - the element block type
C   --   * - return statement iff serious error
