C   --*** IDBLNK *** (EXOLIB) Return link index
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 12/03/87
C   --
C   --IDBLNK returns the link index of the element.

C   --      set if IELBLK <= 0
C   --   IEL - IN - the element number; assumed first in block if <= 0
C   --   IXELB - IN - the cumulative element counts by element block
C   --   NUMLNK - IN - the number of nodes per element
