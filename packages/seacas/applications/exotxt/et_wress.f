C   --
C   --WRESS writes the element side set information from the database.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NTXT   - IN - the text file
C   --   NUMESS - IN - the number of side sets
C   --   LESSEL - IN - the length of the element side sets element list
C   --   LESSNL - IN - the length of the element side sets node list
C   --   LESSDF - IN - the length of the side set dist factors list
C   --   IDESS  - IN - array containing side set IDS
C   --   NEESS  - IN - array containing the number of sides for each sets
C   --   NDESS  - IN - array containing the number of dist
C                      factors for each set
C   --   IXEESS - IN - array containing the indices into the
C                      LTEESS array which are the locations of the 1st
C                      element of each set
C   --   IXDESS - IN - array containing the indices into the
C                      FACESS array which are the locations of the 1st
C                      distribution factor for each set.
C   --   LTEESS - IN - array containing the elements for all side
C                      sets. Internal element IDS are used in this list
C   --   LTSESS - IN - array containing the sides for all side sets
C   --   FACESS - IN - array containing dist factors for all side sets
C   --   NNESS  - IN - the number of nodes for each side set
C   --   IXNESS - IN - index into LTNESS - the 1st node for each side set
C   --   LTNESS - IN - array of nodes for all side sets
C   --   LTNNN  - IN - array of number of nodes for each side in a side set
