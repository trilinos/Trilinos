C   --
C   --WRNPS writes the nodal point set information from the database.

C   --   NNNPS - IN - the number of nodes for each set
C   --   IXNNPS - IN - the index of the first node for each set
C   --   LSTNPS - IN - the nodes for all sets
C   --   FACNPS - IN - the distribution factors for all sets

C   --   NTXT   - IN - the text file
C   --   NUMNPS - IN - the number of nodal point sets
C   --   LNPSNL - IN - length of node set node list
C   --   LNPSDF - IN - length of node set distribution factor list
C   --   IDNPS  - IN - array containing the node set ID's for each node set
C   --   NNNPS  - IN - array containing the number of nodes for each node set
C   --   NDNPS  - IN - array containing number of dist. fact for each node set
C   --   IXNNPS - IN - array containing indices into the LTNNPS array which
C                      are the location of the 1st nodes for each set
C   --   IXDNPS - IN - array containing indices into the FACNPS array which
C                      are the location of the 1st dist factor for each set
C   --   LTNNPS - IN - array containing the nodes for all node sets
C                      Internal node IDs
C   --   FACNPS - IN - array containing the distribtion factors
