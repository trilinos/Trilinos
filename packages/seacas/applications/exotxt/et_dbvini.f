      SUBROUTINE DBVINI (NVARGL, NVARNP, NVAREL)
C=======================================================================

C   --*** DBVINI *** (EXOLIB) Initialize for DBVTYP and DBVIX
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/14/87
C   --
C   --DBVINI initializes the indices for DBVTYP and DBVID.  It must be
C   --called before either of the other two routines are called.
C   --
C   --Note that the indices are shared because the other two routines
C   --are ENTRY routines of DBVINI.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NVARGL - IN - the number of global variables
C   --   NVARNP - IN - the number of nodal variables
C   --   NVAREL - IN - the number of element variables

      INTEGER IXGV, IXNV, IXEV, IXGVE, IXNVE, IXEVE
      common /dbv/ IXGV, IXNV, IXEV, IXGVE, IXNVE, IXEVE

      INTEGER NVARGL, NVARNP, NVAREL

      SUBROUTINE DBVIX (ITYP, IID, IX)
C=======================================================================

C   --*** DBVIX *** (EXOLIB) Return the variable index
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/14/87
C   --
C   --DBVIX is passed a variable type and number.  It returns the variable
C   --index.
C   --
C   --Note that DBVINI must be called before this routine to initialize
C   --the indices.  The indices are shared because this routine is an
C   --ENTRY routine of DBVINI.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   ITYP - IN  - the variable type: 'G'lobal, 'N'odal, 'E'lement
C   --   IID  - IN  - the variable number within the type
C   --   IX   - OUT - the variable index

      common /dbv/ IXGV, IXNV, IXEV, IXGVE, IXNVE, IXEVE
