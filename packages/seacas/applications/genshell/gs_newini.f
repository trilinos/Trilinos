C   --*** NEWINI *** (GEN3D) Calculate 3D initial variables
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 09/02/87
C   --
C   --NEWINI calculates the initial variables for the 3D database.
C   --The output number of nodes and elements and the length of the node
C   --sets and the side sets must be calculated before NEWINI is called.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   IDNSUR - IN - the number of surface node sets
C   --   IDESUR - IN - the number of surface side sets
C   --   NSSUR - IN - the number of nodes in the surface side set
C   --
C   --Common Variables:
C   --   Uses NDIM, NUMNP, NUMEL, NELBLK,
C   --      NUMNPS, LNPSNL, NUMESS, LESSEL, LESSNL of /DBNUMS/
C   --   Uses NUMNP3, NUMEL3, LNPSN3, LESSE3, LESSN3 of /DBNUM3/
C   --   Uses LNPSNO, LESSEO, LESSNO of /DBNUM3/
C   --   Sets NUMNP3, NDIM3, NUMEL3, NELBL3,
C   --      NNPS3, LNPSN3, NESS3, LESSE3, LESSN3 of /DBNUM3/
C   --   Uses NNREPL, NEREPL of /PARAMS/
