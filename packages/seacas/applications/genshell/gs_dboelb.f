C   --*** DBOELB *** (EXOLIB) Write database element blocks
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/12/87
C   --
C   --DBOELB writes the element block information to the database.
C   --Some dynamic dimensioning is done.

C   --Parameters:
C   --   NDB - IN - the database file
C   --   NELBS, NELBE - IN - the number of first and last element blocks
C   --      to write
C   --   IDELB - IN - the element block IDs for each block
C   --   NUMELB - IN - the number of elements in each block
C   --   NUMLNK - IN - the number of nodes per element in each block
C   --   NUMATR - IN - the number of attributes in each block
C   --   LINK - IN - the connectivity for each block
C   --   ATRIB - IN - the attributes for each block
C   --   ATRIBNW - IN - the new attributes if block is a 3D beam
