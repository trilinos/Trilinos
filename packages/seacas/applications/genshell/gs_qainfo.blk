      CHARACTER*32 CVSREV, CVSDAT

C     The CVS* variables are updated by the CVS/RCS program every time
C     this routine is commited to the repository.  Therefore, whenever 
C     there are any changes to any routines, this routine should also 
C     be committed.  The assignment to QAINFO(I) strips off the 'Revision'
C     and 'Date' strings from the CVS variables.  Kludgey but it might work.
      
      CVSREV = '$Revision: 1.15 $'
      CVSDAT = '$Date: 2007/08/06 21:03:15 $'

      QAINFO(1) = 'GenShell                        '
      QAINFO(3) = '                                '

      if (cvsrev(1:1) .eq. '$') then
         LREV = LENSTR(CVSREV) - 12
         QAINFO(2) = CVSDAT(10:17)
         QAINFO(3)(MAX(1,8-LREV):8) = CVSREV(12:11+LREV)
      else
         lrev = lenstr(cvsrev)
         QAINFO(2) = CVSDAT(3:10)
         QAINFO(3)(MAX(1,9-LREV):8) = CVSREV(1:LREV)
      end if
