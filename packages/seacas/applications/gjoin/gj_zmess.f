C   --*** ZMESS *** (GJOIN) Compress element side sets
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 01/20/88
C   --
C   --ZMESS compresses the element side sets by removing deleted elements
C   --and their nodes.  Assumes that the elements and nodes are already
C   --renumbered and ordered.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NUMESS - IN/OUT - the number of element side sets
C   --   LESSEL - IN/OUT - the length of the element side sets element list
C   --   IDESS - IN/OUT - the element side set ID for each set
C   --   NEESS - IN/OUT - the number of elements for each set
C   --   NEDSS - IN/OUT - the number of dist-fac for each set
C   --   IXEESS - IN/OUT - the index of the first element for each set
C   --   IXEDSS - IN/OUT - the index of the first dist-fac for each set
C   --   LTEESS - IN/OUT - the elements for all sets
C   --   LTSSS - IN/OUT - the sides for all sets
C   --   LTSNC - IN/OUT - the face count for each element/side in the list
C   --   FACESS - IN/OUT - the distribution factors for all sets????????????
