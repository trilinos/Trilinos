C - Added EXPXYZ - By material matching
C - Fixes in expxyz, matxyz, comand, irennp
C - added mirroring, scaling, offsetting
C - Added sorting to matxyz/expxyz -- seems to work better (2-4 times faster)
c - Added revolve and revcen commands
c - Added expect command
c - Added copyright notice
c - Added CUBIT kludge
C - Added adding %gjoin
c - Added bar mirroring connectivity fixup
c - Added code to disregard comments (from aprepro?) at beginning of input file
c - Modified so no temporary file
C - fixed problems with the no temporary fix
c - fixed input problem in setitl.f (used getinp instead of frefld)
c - strip leading spaces from filenames
c - added CHANGE to setsta -- assign new id to old id
c - more functionality in setsta CHANGE
c - sort on largest overlap delta direction
c - bug fix last change
c - problem with link array size not getting updated
c - zero variables if no second database
c - efficiency
c - check for zero length sideset element list
c - needsdoubleescape for prt* routines
c - fix accessing z array for 2D problems
c - made 'closest' the default matching behavior, always on
c - fix renix call for link arrays.
c - missing mdlong for yn zn in gjoin.f
c - handle comments better
c - fix connectivity input to reduce mdlong calls
c - fix element map handling, error detection, coordinate names
c - fix info record filename appending
c - fix attribute reading, better file open diagnostics
c - fix info recore filename appending (again...)
c - fix maximum element block names -- now dynamic
c - add increment, fix problem with block name reserve
c - fix incorrect memory error message in rdgen
c - fix exodus error reporting
c - fix by-material matching
c - minor change in setsta help message
c - check block names when merging blocks
c - removed unused routines
c - reorder writing of qa and info
c - modified to use sides instead of nodes for sidesets.
c - remove debugging code in zmess
c - fix for no sideset distribution factors
c - fix for incorrect dist factor offset for 3 or more dbs
c - matching mods -- pick based on set size.
c - removed write of element map -- default provided by exodusII
c - eliminate writing distribution factors if they are all unity
c - better message for dist factor error; write dist factor even if all unity..
c - mirroring of 20-node hexes
c - add addlog
c - fix 'grepos' in error message
c - mirroring of tet sidesets supported if only tets in model
c - use expclb instead of multiple calls to expelb
c - fix so can combine two blocks with same id
c - handle mirroring in models with all shells
c - fix shell sset mirroring -- since connectivity is fixed up, the shell side remains the same
c - optimize nodeset combining since locint was taking lots of time on some compilers
c - fixing sideset node count information for large models
c - fixing sideset df copy if no sideset df
c - call mdfree()
