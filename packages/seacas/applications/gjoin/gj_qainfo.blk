c - added CHANGE to setsta -- assign new id to old id
c - more functionality in setsta CHANGE
c - sort on largest overlap delta direction
c - bug fix last change
c - problem with link array size not getting updated
c - zero variables if no second database
c - efficiency
c - check for zero length sideset element list
c - needsdoubleescape for prt* routines

c - mirroring of tet sidesets supported if only tets in model
c - use expclb instead of multiple calls to expelb
c - fix so can combine two blocks with same id
c - handle mirroring in models with all shells
c - fix shell sset mirroring -- since connectivity is fixed up, the shell side remains the same
