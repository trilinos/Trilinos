C   --*** ZMNPS *** (GJOIN) Compress nodal point sets
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 01/20/88
C   --
C   --ZMNPS compresses the nodal point sets by removing deleted nodes.
C   --Assumes that the nodes are already renumbered and ordered.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NUMNPS - IN - the number of nodal point sets
C   --   LNPSNL - IN/OUT - the length of the nodal point sets node list
C   --   IDNPS - IN - the nodal point set ID for each set
C   --   NNNPS - IN/OUT - the number of nodes for each set
C   --   IXNNPS - IN/OUT - the index of the first node for each set
C   --   LTNNPS - IN/OUT - the nodes for all sets
C   --   FACNPS - IN/OUT - the distribution factors for all sets
