C   --
C   --MIRSS mirrors a side set and (if USESDF true) the distribution factors

C   --
C   --   NUMESS - IN/OUT - the number of element side sets
C   --   LESSEL - IN/OUT - the length of the element side sets element list
C   --   IDESS - IN/OUT - the element side set ID for each set
C   --   NEESS - IN/OUT - the number of elements for each set
C   --   NEDSS - IN/OUT - the number of dist-fac for each set
C   --   IXEESS - IN/OUT - the index of the first element for each set
C   --   IXEDSS - IN/OUT - the index of the first dist-fac for each set
C   --   LTEESS - IN/OUT - the elements for all sets
C   --   LTSSS - IN/OUT - the sides for all sets
C   --   LTSNC - IN/OUT - the face count for each element/side in the list
C   --   FACESS - IN/OUT - the distribution factors for all sets????????????
C   --   USESDF - IN - true if df are non-unity, false if all unity
C   --   NONQUAD - IN - true if model contains non-hex/non-quad elements
