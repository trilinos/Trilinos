      SUBROUTINE AVG(IGLND,INVCN,MAXLN,INVLEN,SOLEA,SOLENA,ITT,iblk)
C
C************************************************************************
C
C Subroutine AVG provides for translating nodal values of element
C variables back to the element centroids for the special case where 
C too few elements can be associated with a node. Element variable 
C data is simply averaged at that node.
