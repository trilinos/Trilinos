C
C  *********************************************************************
C
C  Subroutine ELTON0 extracts nodal vaules of element variables by
C  looping over each element and summing the value of the variable
C  at that element to each node in the connectivity list for that
C  element. Then the nodal summation of element variables is divided
C  by the number of elements that contributed to that node (resulting
C  in a nodal average of the element value.) This is done for the old
C  mesh elements and nodes to facilitate interpolation.
C
C  Each element block must be processed independently in order to
C  avoid averaging element variables across material boundaries.
C  Note: the last set of DO loops acts over all nodes; to make sense
C        one element block must be completely processed before another
C        element block is sent into this subroutine.
