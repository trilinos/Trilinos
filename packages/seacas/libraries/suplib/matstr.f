C   --*** MATSTR *** (STRLIB) Check if string matches
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 07/01/87
C   --
C   --MATSTR true iff the input string is equal to the match string.
C   --Only NLET letters must be in the input string to match, but if more
C   --letters are given, they must match the match string exactly.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   INSTR - IN - the input string
C   --   MATCH - IN - the match string
C   --   NLET - IN - number of letters that must match; 0 for exact match

      CHARACTER*(*) INSTR
      CHARACTER*(*) MATCH
      INTEGER NLET

      IF (NLET .LE. 0) THEN
         MATSTR = INSTR .EQ. MATCH
      ELSE
         LMATCH = LENSTR (MATCH)
         LMIN = MIN (LMATCH, NLET)
