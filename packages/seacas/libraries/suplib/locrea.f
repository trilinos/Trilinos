C   --*** LOCREA *** (ETCLIB) Find closest real value
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 11/03/87
C   --
C   --LOCREA returns the closest real value to the given value in a list of
C   --real values (which may not be ordered).
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   VALU - the value to be searched for
C   --   NVALUS - the number of values in the list
C   --   VALUS - the list of values

      REAL VALUS(*)
