C   --*** FFNEED *** (FFLIB) Check free-field fields for type
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/21/86
C   --
C   --FFNEED checks that the next free-format fields exist and are of the
C   --appropriate type.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   IFLD - IN - the index of the current field number, NOT incremented
C   --   INTYP - IN - the input types from the free-field reader
C   --   FTYPE - IN - the expected field type:
C   --      C for character, R for real, I for integer, other for character
C   --   NFLD - IN - the number of expected fields
C   --   EXPECT - IN - the value to expect string, for error
C   --   * - return statement if the fields do not exist or are not of the
C   --      expected type; message is printed
