C   --*** SHOCMD *** (ETCLIB) Display list of strings
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/27/86
C   --
C   --SHOCMD displays the list of strings.  The heading for the list is
C   --dependent on HEADER:
C   --   COMMANDS - "Valid Commands"
C   --   null - no heading
C   --   other - HEADER
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   HEADER - IN - the show option (see above)
C   --   LIST - IN - the string list, last entry must be ' '

C   --Routines Called:
C   --   LOCSTR - (STRLIB) Find string

      CHARACTER*(*) HEADER
      CHARACTER*(*) LIST(*)

      IF (HEADER .EQ. 'COMMANDS') THEN
         WRITE (*, 10) 'Valid Commands:'
      ELSE IF (HEADER .NE. ' ') THEN
         WRITE (*, 10) HEADER
      END IF

      NCMD = LOCSTR (' ', 999, LIST) - 1
      WRITE (*, 20) (LIST(I), I=1,NCMD)

      RETURN
   10 FORMAT (/, 1X, 5A)
   20 FORMAT ((4X, 7(A8, :, 2X)))
      END
