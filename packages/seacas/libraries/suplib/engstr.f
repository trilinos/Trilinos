C   --*** ENGSTR *** (STRLIB) Convert real numbers to strings
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/14/86
C   --
C   --ENGSTR converts a set of real numbers into engineering notation
C   --strings.  The real numbers are not compared in any way to get a
C   --consistent set of exponents, etc.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NNUM - IN - the number of numbers in the array set
C   --   NSIG - IN - the maximum number of significant digits, max of 8
C   --   RNUM - IN - the array of real numbers to be converted
C   --   RSTR - OUT - the set of real number strings
C   --   LSTR - OUT - the maximum length of the number strings

C   --Routines Called:
C   --   IENGRX - (included) Get engineering notation exponent

      INTEGER NNUM
      INTEGER NSIG
      REAL RNUM(*)
