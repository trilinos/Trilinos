C   --*** NUM2IX *** (ETCLIB) Change number-in-set to set indices
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 10/23/87
C   --
C   --NUM2IX creates the set indices given the number in each set.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   NSETS - IN - the number of sets
C   --   NINSET - IN - the number in each set
C   --   IXSET - OUT - the set indices; set i = IXSET(i-1)+1 .. IXSET(i)

      INTEGER NINSET(*)
      INTEGER IXSET(0:*)

      IXSET(0) = 0
      DO 10 I = 1, NSETS
         IXSET(I) = IXSET(I-1) + NINSET(I)
   10 CONTINUE

      RETURN
      END
