C   --*** IENGX *** (STRLIB) Internal to NUMSTR
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/14/86
C   --
C   --IENGRX returns the "best" engineering notation exponent for a
C   --minimum and maximum exponent.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   IMAXE - IN - the maximum exponent
C   --   IMINE - IN - the minimum exponent

      INTEGER IMAXE, IMINE

      IF (IMAXE .GT. 0) THEN
         IENGRX = INT ((IMAXE - 1) / 3) * 3
      ELSE
         IENGRX = INT ((IMAXE - 2) / 3) * 3
      END IF

      RETURN
