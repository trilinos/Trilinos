C   --*** NUMEQI *** (ETCLIB) Count number of occurrences of integer in list
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 11/10/87
C   --
C   --NUMEQI returns the number of times the given integer occurs in a list
C   --of integers.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   INT - IN - the integer to be counted
C   --   LENLST - IN - the number of integers in the list
C   --   INTLST - IN - the list of integers to be searched

      INTEGER INT
      INTEGER LENLST
      INTEGER INTLST(*)

      NUMEQI = 0
      DO 10 I = 1, LENLST
         IF (INT .EQ. INTLST(I)) NUMEQI = NUMEQI + 1
   10 CONTINUE

      RETURN
      END
