C                   first true command line argument after the

      INTEGER FUNCTION COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT()
C
C Description. Returns the number of command arguments.
C
C Class. Inquiry function
C
C Arguments. None.
C
C Result Characteristics. Scalar default integer.
C
C Result Value. The result value is equal to the number of command
C   arguments available. If there are no command arguments available
C   or if the processor does not support command arguments, then
C   the result value is 0. If the processor has a concept of a command
C   name, the command name does not count as one of the command
C   arguments.

      COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT = IARGC()

      END

      SUBROUTINE GET_COMMAND(COMMAND,LENGTH,STATUS)
C
C Description. Returns the entire command by which the program was
C   invoked.
C
C Class. Subroutine.
C
C Arguments.
C COMMAND (optional) shall be scalar and of type default character.
C   It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. It is assigned the entire command
C   by which the program was invoked. If the command cannot be
C   determined, COMMAND is assigned all blanks.
C LENGTH (optional) shall be scalar and of type default integer. It is
C   an INTENT(OUT) argument. It is assigned the significant length
C   of the command by which the program was invoked. The significant
C   length may include trailing blanks if the processor allows commands
C   with significant trailing blanks. This length does not consider any
C   possible truncation or padding in assigning the command to the
C   COMMAND argument; in fact the COMMAND argument need not even be
C   present. If the command length cannot be determined, a length of
C   0 is assigned.
C STATUS (optional) shall be scalar and of type default integer. It is
C   an INTENT(OUT) argument. It is assigned the value 0 if the
C   command retrieval is sucessful. It is assigned a processor-dependent
C   non-zero value if the command retrieval fails.
C
C NOTE
C (1) The Fortran 77 implementation of this routine does not support
C     optional arguments, so all arguments must be specified by the
C     caller.

      SUBROUTINE GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT(NUMBER8,VALUE,LENGTH8,STATUS8)
C
C Description. Returns a command argument.
C
C Class. Subroutine.
C
C Arguments.
C NUMBER shall be scalar and of type default integer. It is an
C   INTENT(IN) argument. It specifies the number of the command
C   argument that the other arguments give information about. Useful
C   values of NUMBER are those between 0 and the argument count
C   returned by the COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT intrinsic.
C   Other values are allowed, but will result in error status return
C   (see below).  Command argument 0 is defined to be the command
C   name by which the program was invoked if the processor has such
C   a concept. It is allowed to call the GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT
C   procedure for command argument number 0, even if the processor
C   does not define command names or other command arguments.
C   The remaining command arguments are numbered consecutively from
C   1 to the argument count in an order determined by the processor.
C VALUE (optional) shall be scalar and of type default character.
C   It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. It is assigned the value of the
C   command argument specified by NUMBER. If the command argument value
C   cannot be determined, VALUE is assigned all blanks.
C LENGTH (optional) shall be scalar and of type default integer.
C   It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. It is assigned the significant length
C   of the command argument specified by NUMBER. The significant
C   length may include trailing blanks if the processor allows command
C   arguments with significant trailing blanks. This length does not
C   consider any possible truncation or padding in assigning the
C   command argument value to the VALUE argument; in fact the
C   VALUE argument need not even be present. If the command
C   argument length cannot be determined, a length of 0 is assigned.
C STATUS (optional) shall be scalar and of type default integer.
C   It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. It is assigned the value 0 if
C   the argument retrieval is sucessful. It is assigned a
C   processor-dependent non-zero value if the argument retrieval fails.
C
C NOTE
C (1) One possible reason for failure is that NUMBER is negative or
C     greater than COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT().
C (2) The Fortran 77 implementation of this routine does not support
C     optional arguments, so all arguments must be specified by the
C     caller.

          RETURN
      ENDIF

C Get the argument

      CALL GETARG(NUMBER,VALUE)
C
C The LENGTH option is fairly pointless under Unix.
C Trailing spaces can only be specified using quotes.
C Since the command line has already been processed by the
C shell before the application sees it, we have no way of
C knowing the true length of any quoted arguments.
C Just find last non-blank character in string.
C
      LENGTH = LEN_TRIMF2K(VALUE)
      length8 = length

C Since GETARG does not return a result code, assume success
