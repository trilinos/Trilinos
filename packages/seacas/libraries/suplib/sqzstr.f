C   --*** SQZSTR *** (STRLIB) Remove extra blanks from string
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 06/02/87
C   --
C   --SQZSTR deletes leading and extra blanks within a string.
C   --To prevent problems, an empty string is returned with a length of 1.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   STRING - IN/OUT - the string to be compressed, returned, may be
C   --      up to 1024 characters long
C   --   LSTR - OUT - the new string length

C   --Routines Called:
C   --   LENSTR - (STRLIB) Find string length
