C   --*** FFREAL *** (FFLIB) Parse free-field real
C   --   Written by Amy Gilkey - revised 02/24/86
C   --
C   --FFREAL parses a real field.  A default is supplied if the field
C   --is empty.
C   --
C   --Parameters:
C   --   IFLD - IN/OUT - the index of the current field number, incremented
C   --   INTYP - IN - the input type from the free-field reader
C   --   RFIELD - IN - the real field
C   --   EXPECT - IN - the value to expect string, for error
C   --   DEFVAL - IN - the default value if field is empty
C   --   RVAL - OUT - the real value, set only if no error
C   --   * - return statement if the field is invalid; message is printed

      INTEGER IFLD
      INTEGER INTYP(*)
      REAL RFIELD(*)
      CHARACTER*(*) EXPECT
      REAL DEFVAL, RVAL

      CHARACTER*80 ERRMSG

      IF (INTYP(IFLD) .GE. 1) THEN
         RVAL = RFIELD(IFLD)
      ELSE IF (INTYP(IFLD) .LE. -1) THEN
         RVAL = DEFVAL

         GOTO 100
      END IF

      IF (INTYP(IFLD) .GE. -1) IFLD = IFLD + 1
      RETURN

  100 CONTINUE
