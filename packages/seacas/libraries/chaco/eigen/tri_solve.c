/* Solve the shifted, symmetric tridiagonal linear system (T - lambda*I)v = b
   where b is a multiple of e1 (the first column of the identity matrix).
   T is constructed with diagonal alpha[1], alpha[2] ... alpha[j] and
   off diagonal beta[1], beta[2] ... beta[j-1]. The algorithm is based on
   p. 156 of Golub and Van Loan, 2nd ed. Modified this to (1) incorporate
   shift by lambda, (2) use work vectors rather than overwriting so
   won't have to copy input as this is called repeatedly in the bisection
   loop for the extended eigenproblem, and (3) to squawk and die if a
   pivot below machine precision is encountered and (4) exploit the fact
   that all elements of the rhs except the first are 0. */
