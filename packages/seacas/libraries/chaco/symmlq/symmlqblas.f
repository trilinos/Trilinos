c     four phase method     using two built-in constants that are
c     hopefully applicable to all machines.
c         cutlo = maximum of  dsqrt(u/eps)  over all known machines.

c     document the limiting values are as follows..
c     cutlo, s.p.   u/eps = 2**(-102) for  honeywell.  close seconds are
c                   univac and dec at 2**(-103)

c     cuthi, s.p.   v = 2**127 for univac, honeywell, and dec.
c                   thus cuthi = 2**(63.5) = 1.30438e19
c     cutlo, d.p.   u/eps = 2**(-67) for honeywell and dec.
