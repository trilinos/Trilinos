c     this program should function properly on all systems
c     satisfying the following two assumptions,
c        1.  the base used in representing floating point
c            numbers is not a power of three.
c        2.  the quantity  a  in statement 10 is represented to 
c            the accuracy used in floating point variables
c            that are stored in memory.
c     the statement number 10 and the go to 10 are intended to
c     force optimizing compilers to generate code satisfying 
c     assumption 2.
c     under these assumptions, it should be true that,
c            a  is not exactly equal to four-thirds,
c            b  has a zero for its last bit or digit,
c            c  is not exactly equal to one,
c            eps  measures the separation of 1.0 from
c                 the next larger floating point number.
c     the developers of eispack would appreciate being informed
c     about any systems where these assumptions do not hold.
