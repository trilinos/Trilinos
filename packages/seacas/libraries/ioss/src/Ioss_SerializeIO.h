  /**
   * @brief Class <code>SerializeIO</code> is a sentry class which performs serialization
   * for mesh database I/O.
   *
   * This sentry guards serialization of parallel I/O routines.  At construction, it
   * blocks the processes via an MPI barrier, releasing them to execute in groups specified
   * by <code>s_groupSize</code>.  At destruction, it continues to block via MPI barriers
   * until all the processor have been released by the constructor.
   *
   * In the case where the constructor is called, and the sentry is already active and owned
   * by the processes group, the constructor and destructor simply fall through since the
   * serialization is already in place at a higher level.
   *
   * \note All ranks must call the SerializeIO constructor synchronously.
   * \note It is recommended to use RAII and keep the area protected by the SerializeIO as small as
   * possible.
   *
   * The flow is that the ranks are split into groups of the specified size. Assume 3 ranks of group
   * size 1.
   *
   * * First time through,
   *   - rank 0 falls through and
   *   - ranks 1, 2 sit at the barrier
   *   - rank 0 hits the destructor and then all 3 ranks are in the barrier so they all go to next
   * step
   *   - (rank 1,2 in constructor, rank 0 in destructor)
   * * `s_owner` is now equal to `m_groupRank` on rank 1, so it falls out of the do while;
   *   - rank 2 still in the constructor do while Barrier
   *   - rank 0 in the destructor do while Barrier
   *   - rank 1 does its work and calls destructor;
   *   - all ranks in Barrier, so they go to next step.
   * * `s_owner` now equal to `m_groupRank` on rank 2, so if falls out of the do while;
   *   - ranks 0,1 in destructor do while at the Barrier
   *   - rank 2 does it work and calls destructor
   *   - all ranks are now in the destructor Barrier, so they go to next step
   *   - all ranks clear the Destructor and go to next step.
