\section properties Properties

## General Properties

  Property | Value    | Description
 ----------|:--------:|------------
 LOGGING   | on/[off] | enable/disable logging of field input/output
 LOWER_CASE_VARIABLE_NAMES | [on]/off | Convert all variable names read from input database to lowercase; replace ' ' with '_'
 USE_GENERIC_CANONICAL_NAMES | on/[off]  | use `block_{id}` as canonical name of an element block instead of the name (if any) stored on the database. The database name will be an alias.
 IGNORE_DATABASE_NAMES | on/[off] | Do not read any element block, nodeset, ... names if they exist on the database.  Use only the canonical generated names (entitytype + _ + id)
 IGNORE_ATTRIBUTE_NAMES   | on/[off] | Do not read the attribute names that may exist on an input database. Instead for an element block with N attributes, the fields will be named `attribute_1` ... `attribute_N`
 MINIMIZE_OPEN_FILES | on/[off] | If on, then close file after each timestep and then reopen on next output
 SERIALIZE_IO | integer | The number of files that will be read/written to simultaneously in a  parallel file-per-rank run.

## Auto-Decomposition-Related Properties

 Property        | Value  | Description
-----------------|:------:|-----------------------------------------------------------
MODEL_DECOMPOSITION_METHOD | {method} | Decompose a DB with type `MODEL` using `method`
RESTART_DECOMPOSITION_METHOD | {method} | Decompose a DB with type `RESTART_IN` using `method`
DECOMPOSITION_METHOD | {method} | Decompose all input DB using `method`
PARALLEL_CONSISTENCY | [on]/off | On if the client will call Ioss functions consistently on all processors. If off, then the auto-decomp and auto-join cannot be used.
RETAIN_FREE_NODES | [on]/off | In auto-decomp, will nodes not connected to any elements be retained.
LOAD_BALANCE_THRESHOLD | {real} [1.4] | CGNS-Structured only -- Load imbalance permitted Load on Proc / Avg Load
DECOMPOSITION_EXTRA | {name},{multiplier} | Specify the name of the element map or variable used if the decomposition method is `map` or `variable`.  If it contains a comma, the value following the comma is used to scale (divide) the values in the map/variable.  If it is 'auto', then all values will be scaled by `max_value/processorCount`

### Valid values for Decomposition Method

Method     | Description
:---------:|-------------------
rcb        | recursive coordinate bisection

## Setting properties via an environment variable

Although the properties are usually accessed internally in the
application calling the IOSS library, it is possible to set the
properties externally prior to running the application via the setting
of the environment variable `IOSS_PROPERTIES`.  The value of the
variable is one or more colon-separated property/property-value pairs.
For example, to set the `DECOMPOSITION_METHOD` and the `FILE_TYPE`
externally, the following would be used:
```
    export IOSS_PROPERTIES="DECOMPOSITION_METHOD=rib:FILE_TYPE=netcdf4"
```
If the environment variable is set correctly, there should be an
informational message output during running of the application similar
to:
```
	IOSS: Adding property 'DECOMPOSITION_METHOD' with value 'rib'
	IOSS: Adding property 'FILE_TYPE' with value 'netcdf4'
```
