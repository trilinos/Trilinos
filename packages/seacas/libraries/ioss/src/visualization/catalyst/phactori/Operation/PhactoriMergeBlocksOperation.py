  """merge blocks (MergeBlocks) operation, adapter to the catalyst filter

PhactoriMergeBlocksOperation is the phactori manager for working with the
ParaView/Catalyst MergeBlocks() filter and its parameters, providing
access and pipeline/input/output managment via the json, lexx/yacc, or soon
yaml interface. The user may specify a named input to the filter, with the
unnamed default being the incoming data mesh.

The MergeBlocks filter combines all the elements from all blocks of a
multiblock dataset into a single block with one set of elemeeents and one set
of points. The input is, e.g., a vtkMultiBlockDataset, and the output is
usually an vtkUnstructuredGrid or vtkPoly. Sometimes other filters which are
failing will succeed when placed after a MergeBlocks filter.

For moree information on the MergeBlocks() filter from ParaView, see the
ParaView Documentation.

To control the MergeBlocks you have a section in the
"operation blocks" section of the phactori control script which looks like:

::

    "operation blocks":{
      "mymergeblocks1":{
        "type":"mergeblocks"
      }
    }

As with other pipeline operations, you can add an
"input":"other_op_name" line to place this after another operation in the
pipeline such as a clip or a slice or a contour.
