   *         of the set are not necessarily similar, or do not necessarily have the
   *         same topology.
   *
   *   The following derived classes are typical:
   *
   *   -- NodeSet  -- grouping of nodes (0d topology)
   *
   *   -- EdgeSet  -- grouping of edges (1d topology)
   *
   *   -- FaceSet  -- grouping of faces (2d topology) [Surface]
