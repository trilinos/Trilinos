C     Look for a void that is not followed by a dictionary entry.
C     If one is found, release the space to the system.
C     NOTE: In previous versions of SUPES, the memory manager
C           attempted to release memory in the middle of a
C           user's program space.  This was OK most of the
C           time since the memory release was rarely done---even
C           if it was requested to do it.  I've changed this to
C           only allow release from the top of the user's program
C           space.  jrr, 3/5/90.
C           (For reference, the old code had this line:
C
C           IF (VADDR .EQ. DPOINT(IDICT,1,1)
C
C           I've changed it to:
C
C           IF (VADDR .LE. DPOINT(IDICT,1,1)
C
C
      DO 120 IVOID = 1, NVOIDS(1)
         VADDR = VOID(IVOID,1,1) + VOID(IVOID,1,2)
         DO 100 IDICT = 1, NNAMES(1)
            IF (VADDR .LE. DPOINT(IDICT,1,1)
     *         .AND. DPOINT(IDICT,1,2) .GE. 0) GO TO 110
  100    CONTINUE
C
C        Release this void.
C
         CALL EXMEMY (-VOID(IVOID,1,2), VOID(IVOID,1,1)+MYLOC-1, MEMRET)
         IF (MEMRET .LT. 0 .OR. MEMRET .GT. VOID(IVOID,1,2)) THEN
C
C           Illegal memory block size.
C
            LASTER = ILBLK
            RETURN
C
         END IF
C
C        Update void table.
C
         VOID(IVOID,1,2) = MEMRET
  110    CONTINUE
  120 CONTINUE
C
C     Update void table to reflect zero length voids.
C
      CALL VTABLE(1, 0, VOID, LVOID, NVOIDS(1), CHRCOL, LASTER)
