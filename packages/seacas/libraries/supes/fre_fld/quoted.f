      SUBROUTINE QUOTED ( LINE, ILEFT, IRIGHT )
C
      CHARACTER*(*) LINE
C
      CALL STRIPB ( LINE, ILEFT, IRIGHT )
C
C     The first character is required to be a quote, so remove it.
C
      LINE(1:1) = ' '
      ILEFT = 2
      IBEGIN = 2
C
C     Begin loop looking for more quotes.  There should be at least 1 more.
C

         IQUOTE = INDEX ( LINE(IBEGIN:IRIGHT), '''' )
C
C        Has the quote ended within this record?

C
C        The quote is internal -- check for double quote.
C
         IF ( LINE(IQUOTE+1:IQUOTE+1) .NE. '''' ) THEN
C
C           The quote is single, thus ending the quoted string.

            RETURN
         END IF
C
C        The quote is a double quote.  Remove the repeated quote and loop.
C
