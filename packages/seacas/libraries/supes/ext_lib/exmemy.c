/*
 *  NOTES ON MODULE EXMEMY:
 *
 * -2. The big assumption on which this is based is that a FTNINT
 *     which is either an int or a long int, is the same size as
 *     the void* returned by malloc. There are both compile-time
 *     and run-time assertions that attempt to catch this.
 *
 * -1. The information below is the original implementation. At that
 *     time, the only C routines linked with most executables were the
 *     supes library itself and there were no other routines calling
 *     'sbrk' and life was good. This situation has changed with the
 *     addition of the exodusII, netcdf, nemesis, and other libraries.
 *     Some of these are C-based and do 'malloc' and 'free'
 *     calls. Most man pages for 'malloc' and 'sbrk' warn of dire
 *     consequences of mixing calls to 'malloc' and 'sbrk' and we have
 *     had instances of memory corruption under the old model. To
 *     eliminate this undefined and undesirable behavior, the EXMEMY
 *     routine has been rewritten to use 'malloc' and 'free' instead
 *     of 'sbrk' calls. The PAGESIZE manipulations have also been
 *     removed since the underlying 'malloc' implementation is better
 *     at dealing with this than we are (hopefully).
 *
 *     The implementation of 'free' is somewhat of a kluge and
 *     required changes to the calling 'mem_mgr' routines.  Specifically,
 *
 *     1) A few routines were disabled -- mdget which is supposed to
 *     get a large block of memory and parcel it out in smaller chunks.
 *     This minimizes system calls, but is incompatible with 'free' since
 *     memory passed to 'mddel' may not be on a boundary obtained
 *     my malloc.
 *
 *     2) 'mdlong' is mapped to 'realloc'.  A flag is passed into the
 *     exmemy call which tells whether we are freeing memory or
 *     changing size.  The '*memret' argument is used to pass the flag
 *     in to avoid changing the interface to exmemy.
 *
 *     3) 'deferred' mode is eliminated; all memory requests are
 *     satisfied immediately.
 *
 *     4) 'mdcomp' is also eliminated.
 *
 *     The interface has not been changed; the disabled calls are
 *     just noops.
 *
 *     ---Below here is historical notes---
 *
 *  0. On a request for more memory, we ask for it in multiples of
 *     PAGES of memory of size PAGESIZE.  The reason is that on allocation,
 *     the memory manager does keep track the voids in memory.  Unfortunately,
 *     the same cannot be said for the voids created on deallocation, so...
 *
 *  1. The SUPES memory handler, EXMEMY, normally deallocates memory
 *     only if one asks for it a a location that is an exact page multiple.
 *     Further, the memory manager used to try to release memory
 *     from each memory block---this, of course, assumes that the OS
 *     allows for gaps in a users data space.  It so happens that VMS
 *     does.  I've changed the memory manager (cf. mem_mgr/mxgive) so that
 *     it now only tries to release a void if it is at the top of the
 *     program space.  I release as much as I can on any given release
 *     request.
 *
 *  2. Although it's not clear from the comments, or from the documentation
 *     that I've read, on deallocation *memrtn is the amount of memory that
 *     exmemy was *NOT* able to return to the system.  Still unclear?
 *     An example:  Suppose that I tried to return 524 bytes to the system.
 *     Ultimately, I would do this through a call to exmemy with a value
 *     for *memreq of -524 / Numsize (remember we ask to give in numeric
 *     storage units).  Assuming that the amount actually returned
 *     was 512 then *memrtn should be set to 12 divided by the NumSize
 *     for most systems---see the comments below for the Cray strategy.
 *     (memrtn is now the amount of memory released/allocated.  If it is
 *      less than zero, an error occurred)
