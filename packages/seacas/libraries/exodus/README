BUILDING

There are 4 methods for building exodusII.

1. SEAMS/SEACAS Build system which is based on imake.  If you have a
SEAMS or SEACAS installation, you can use its build system.  In the
top-level exodusii directory, do 'accmkmf' followed by 'make
Makefiles' and then 'make'

2. CMAKE: type 'cmake .' or 'cmake -i' to generate the Makefiles
followed by 'make'.  Cmake will search for the netcdf include file in
the directories:
	${ACCESS}/inc,
	${NETCDF_DIR}/inc,
	${NETCDF_DIR}/libsrc

and the netcdf library in the directories:
	${ACCESS}/lib, 
	${NETCDF_DIR}/lib,
	${NETCDF_DIR}/libsrc/.libs

You should one of the environment variables ACCESS or NETCDF_DIR to
point to the location of your netcdf installation.

3. Makefile.standalone.  Edit the top-level Makefile.standalone file
and specify the compiler and other options as detailed in the
file. Then, do "make -f Makefile.standalone".

4. Building in the Trilinos system as part of the seacas package. 
See the Trilinos documentation for more details.

Once you have built the library, you can test it by typing "make
check"


========================================================================
NETCDF

The exodusII library uses the netcdf library for low-level data
storage.

ExodusII requires NetCDF version 3.6.0 or later with the "large-model
modifications".  NetCDF version 4.1 or later is highly recommended.

The netcdf library must be modified slightly in order to handle the
exodusII datamodel. The specific changes are:

1. libsrc/netcdf.h -- Modify the following defines:
   libsrc4/netcdf_base.h (netcdf-4.X only)
   libsrc4/netcdf.h      (netcdf-4.X only if it exists)

#define NC_MAX_DIMS	65536	 /* max dimensions per file */
#define NC_MAX_VARS	524288	 /* max variables per file */
#define NC_MAX_VAR_DIMS	8        /* max per variable dimensions */

If these changes are not made, the exodus library will still function
for "normal" size models, but it will fail for "large" models. The
error message from exodus/netcdf should be somewhat clear when this
happens... 

2. When running the netcdf tests, you may have to do "unlimit
stacksize" (csh/tcsh) to avoid some failures due to the increased define sizes
above.
