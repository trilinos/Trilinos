The function ex_get_info() reads information records from the
database. The records are MAX_LINE_LENGTH-character
strings. Memory must be allocated for the information records before
this call is made. The number of records can be determined by invoking
ex_inquire() or ex_inquire_int().

\returns In case of an error, ex_get_info() returns a negative number;
         a warning will return a positive number. Possible causes of errors
         include:
  -  data file not properly opened with call to ex_create() or ex_open()
  -  a warning value is returned if no information records were stored.

\param[in]  exoid   exodus file ID returned from a previous call to ex_create()
or ex_open().
\param[out] info    Returned array containing the information records.

The following code segment will determine the number of information
records and read them from an open exodus file :

~~~{.c}
int error, exoid, num_info;
char *info[MAXINFO];

\comment{read information records}
num_info = ex_inquire_int (exoid,EX_INQ_INFO);
for (i=0; i < num_info; i++) {
   info[i] = (char *) calloc ((MAX_LINE_LENGTH+1), sizeof(char));
}
error = ex_get_info (exoid, info);
~~~
