\ingroup Utilities

\note The ex_open_int() is an internal function called by
ex_open(). The user should call ex_open() and not ex_open_int().

The function ex_open() opens an existing exodus file and returns
an ID that can subsequently be used to refer to the file, the word
size of the floating point values stored in the file, and the version
of the exodus database (returned as a ``float'', regardless of the
compute or I/O word size). Multiple files may be ``open'' simultaneously.

\return In case of an error, ex_open() returns a negative
number. Possible causes of errors include:
  -  The specified file does not exist.
  -  The mode specified is something other than the predefined constant
\fparam{#EX_READ} or \fparam{#EX_WRITE}.
  -  Database version is earlier than 2.0.

\param path The file name of the exodus file. This can be given as either an
            absolute path name (from the root of the file system) or a relative
            path name (from the current directory).

\param mode Access mode. Use one of the following predefined constants:
        -  \fparam{EX_READ} To open the file just for reading.
        -  \fparam{EX_WRITE} To open the file for writing and reading.

\param[in,out] comp_ws The word size in bytes (0, 4 or 8) of the floating point
variables
               used in the application program. If 0 (zero) is passed, the
               default size of floating point values for the machine will be
               used and returned in this variable. WARNING: all exodus functions
               requiring reals must be passed reals declared with this passed
               in or returned compute word size (4 or 8).


\param[in,out] io_ws The word size in bytes (0, 4 or 8) of the floating
                    point data as they are stored in the exodus file. If the
                    word size does not match the word size of data stored in
                    the file, a fatal error is returned. If this argument is
                    0, the word size of the floating point data already
                    stored in the file is returned.

\param[out] version  Returned exodus database version number. Note that this is always a float,
                     never a double.

\param[in] run_version Internally generated to verify library compatibility.

The following opens an exodus file named \file{test.exo} for read
only, using default settings for compute and I/O word sizes:

~~~{.c}
int CPU_word_size,IO_word_size, exoid;
float version;

CPU_word_size = sizeof(float);   \co{float or double}
IO_word_size = 0;                \co{use what is stored in file}

\comment{open exodus files}
exoid = ex_open ("test.exo",     \co{filename path}
                 EX_READ,        \co{access mode = READ}
                 &CPU_word_size, \co{CPU word size}
                 &IO_word_size,  \co{IO word size}
                 &version);      \co{ExodusII library version}
~~~
