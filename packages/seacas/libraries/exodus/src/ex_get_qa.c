/*!
The function ex_get_qa() reads the QA records from the database. Each
QA record contains four MAX_STR_LENGTH-byte character
strings. The character strings are:
 -  the analysis code name
 -  the analysis code QA descriptor
 -  the analysis date
 -  the analysis time

Memory must be allocated for the QA records before this call is
made. The number of QA records can be determined by invoking
ex_inquire().

\return In case of an error, ex_get_qa() returns a negative number; a
        warning will return a positive number.  Possible causes of errors
        include:
  -  data file not properly opened with call to ex_create() or ex_open()
  -  a warning value is returned if no QA records were stored.

\param[in] exoid          exodus file ID returned from a previous call to
ex_create() or ex_open().
\param[out]  qa_record    Returned array containing the QA records.

The following will determine the number of QA records and
read them from the open exodus file:

~~~{.c}
int num_qa_rec, error, exoid
char *qa_record[MAX_QA_REC][4];

\comment{read QA records}
num_qa_rec = ex_inquire_int(exoid, EX_INQ_QA);

for (i=0; i<num_qa_rec; i++) {
    for (j=0; j<4; j++)
    qa_record[i][j] = (char *) calloc ((MAX_STR_LENGTH+1), sizeof(char));
}
error = ex_get_qa (exoid, qa_record);
