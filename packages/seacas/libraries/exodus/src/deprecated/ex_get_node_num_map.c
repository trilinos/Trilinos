\deprecated Use ex_get_id_map()(exoid, EX_NODE_MAP, node_map)

The function ex_get_node_num_map() reads the optional node number
mapnode number map from the database. See Section LocalNodeIds for a
description of the node number map. If a node number map is not stored
in the data file, a default array (1,2,3,. .. num_nodes) is
returned. Memory must be allocated for the node number map array
(num_nodes in length) before this call is made.

\return In case of an error, ex_get_node_num_map() returns a negative
number; a warning will return a positive number. Possible causes of
errors include:
  -  data file not properly opened with call to ex_create() or ex_open()
  -  if a node number map is not stored, a default map and a warning value are
returned.

\param[in]   exoid      exodus file ID returned from a previous call to
ex_create() or ex_open().
\param[out]  node_map   Returned node number map.

The following code will read a node number map from an open exodus
file :

~~~{.c}
int *node_map, error, exoid;

\comment{read node number map}
node_map = (int *)calloc(num_nodes, sizeof(int));
error = ex_get_node_num_map(exoid, node_map);

\comment{Equivalent using non-deprecated function}
error = ex_get_id_map(exoid, EX_NODE_MAP, node_map);
~~~
