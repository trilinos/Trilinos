/**
\deprecated Use ex_get_block()(exoid, EX_ELEM_BLOCK, elem_blk_id, elem_type,
num_elem_this_blk, num_nodes_per_elem, num_attr) instead

The function ex_get_elem_block() reads the parameters used to describe
an element block. IDs of all element blocks stored can be determined
by calling ex_get_elem_blk_ids().

\return In case of an error, ex_get_elem_block() returns a negative
number; a warning will return a positive number. Possible causes of
errors include:
  -  data file not properly opened with call to ex_create() or ex_open()
  -  element block with specified ID is not stored in the data file.

\param[in]  exoid              exodus file ID returned from a previous call to
ex_create() or ex_open().
\param[in]  elem_blk_id        The element block ID.
\param[out] elem_type          Returned element typetype of elements in the
element block.
                               The maximum length of this string is \p
MAX_STR_LENGTH .
\param[out] num_elem_this_blk  Returned number of elements in the element block.
\param[out] num_nodes_per_elem Returned number of nodes per element in the
element block.
\param[out] num_attr           Returned number of attributes per element in the
element block.

As an example, the following code segment will read the parameters for
the element block with an ID of 10 and read the connectivity and
element attributes arrays from an open exodus file :

~~~{.c}
#include "exodusII.h"
int id, error, exoid, num_el_in_blk, num_nod_per_el, num_attr,
    *connect;
float *attrib;
char elem_type[MAX_STR_LENGTH+1];

\comment{read element block parameters}
id = 10;

error = ex_get_elem_block(exoid, id, elem_type, &num_el_in_blk,
                          &num_nod_per_elem, &num_attr);

\comment{read element connectivity}
connect = (int *) calloc(num_nod_per_el*num_el_in_blk,
                         sizeof(int));

error = ex_get_elem_conn(exoid, id, connect);

\comment{read element block attributes}
attrib = (float *) calloc (num_attr * num_el_in_blk, sizeof(float));
error = ex_get_elem_attr (exoid, id, attrib);

\comment{Same result using non-deprecated functions}
error = ex_get_block(exoid, EX_ELEM_BLOCK, id, elem_type, &num_el_in_blk,
                     &num_nod_per_elem, 0, 0, &num_attr);
error = ex_get_conn (exoid, EX_ELEM_BLOCK, id, connect);
error = ex_get_attr (exoid, EX_ELEM_BLOCK, id, attrib);
