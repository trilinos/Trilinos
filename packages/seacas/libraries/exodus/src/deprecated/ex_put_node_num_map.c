\deprecated Use ex_put_id_map()(exoid, EX_NODE_MAP, node_map)

The function ex_put_node_num_map() writes out the optional node number
map to the database. See Section LocalNodeIds for a description of the
node number map. The function ex_put_init() must be invoked before
this call is made.

\return In case of an error, ex_put_node_num_map() returns a negative
number; a warning will return a positive number. Possible causes of
errors include:
  -  data file not properly opened with call to ex_create() or ex_open()
  -  data file opened for read only.
  -  data file not initialized properly with call to ex_put_init().
  -  a node number map already exists in the file.

\param[in]  exoid     exodus file ID returned from a previous call to
ex_create() or ex_open().
\param[in]  node_map  The node number map.

The following code generates a default node number map and outputs it
to an open exodus file. This is a trivial case and included just for
illustration. Since this map is optional, it should be written out
only if it contains something other than the default map.

~~~{.c}
int error, exoid;
int *node_map = (int *)calloc(num_nodes, sizeof(int));

for (i=1; i <= num_nodes; i++)
   node_map[i-1] = i;

error = ex_put_node_num_map(exoid, node_map);

\comment{Equivalent using non-deprecated function}
error = ex_put_id_map(exoid, EX_NODE_MAP, node_map);
~~~
