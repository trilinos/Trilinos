\deprecated Use ex_get_concat_sets()(exoid, EX_NODE_SET, set_specs) instead

The function ex_get_concat_node_sets() reads the node set ID's, node
set node count array, node set distribution factors count array, node
set node pointers array, node set distribution factors pointer array,
node set node list, and node set distribution factors for all of the
node sets. ``Concatenated node sets'' refers to the arrays required to
define all of the node sets (ID array, counts arrays, pointers arrays,
node list array, and distribution factors array) as described in
Section 3.10 on page 11.

Because the distribution factors are floating point values, the
application code must declare the array passed to be the appropriate
type (float or double) to match the compute word size passed in
ex_create() or ex_open().

The length of each of the returned arrays can be determined by
invoking ex_inquire() or ex_inquire_int().

\return In case of an error, ex_get_concat_node_sets() returns a
negative number; a warning will return a positive number. Possible
causes of errors include:
  -  data file not properly opened with call to ex_create() or ex_open()
  -  a warning value is returned if no node sets are stored in the file.


\param[in]  exoid                 exodus file ID returned from a previous call
to ex_create()
                                  or ex_open().

\param[out]  node_set_ids         Returned array containing the node set ID for
each set.

\param[out]  num_nodes_per_set    Returned array containing the number of nodes
for each set.

\param[out]  num_df_per_set       Returned array containing the number of
distribution factors for each
                                  set.

\param[out]  node_sets_node_index Returned array containing the indices into the
node_set_node_list
                                  which are the locations of the first node for
each set. These indices
                                  are 0-based.

\param[out]  node_sets_df_index   Returned array containing the indices into the
node_set_dist_fact
                                  which are the locations of the first
distribution factor for each
                                  set. These indices are 0-based.

\param[out]  node_sets_node_list  Returned array containing the nodes for all
sets. Internal node IDs
                                  are used in this list (see Section
LocalNodeIds).

\param[out]  node_sets_dist_fact  Returned array containing the distribution
factors for all sets.


As an example, the following code segment will read concatenated node
sets:

~~~{.c}

int error, exoid, num_node_sets, list_len, *ids,
    *num_nodes_per_set, *num_df_per_set, *node_ind,
    *df_ind, *node_list;

float *dist_fact

\comment{read concatenated node sets}
num_node_sets = ex_inquire_int(exoid, EX_INQ_NODE_SETS);

ids               = (int *) calloc(num_node_sets, sizeof(int));
num_nodes_per_set = (int *) calloc(num_node_sets, sizeof(int));
num_df_per_set    = (int *) calloc(num_node_sets, sizeof(int));
node_ind          = (int *) calloc(num_node_sets, sizeof(int));
df_ind            = (int *) calloc(num_node_sets, sizeof(int));

list_len = ex_inquire_int(exoid, EX_INQ_NS_NODE_LEN);
node_list = (int *) calloc(list_len, sizeof(int));

list_len = ex_inquire_int(exoid, EX_INQ_NS_DF_LEN);
dist_fact = (float *) calloc(list_len, sizeof(float));

error = ex_get_concat_node_sets (exoid, ids, num_nodes_per_set,
                                 num_df_per_set, node_ind, df_ind,
                                 node_list, dist_fact);
