/*!
\deprecated Use ex_get_var()(exoid, time_step, EX_ELEM_BLOCK, elem_var_index,
elem_blk_id, num_elem_this_blk, elem_var_vals) instead

The function ex_get_elem_var() reads the values of a single element
variable for one element block at one time step. Memory must be
allocated for the element variable values array before this function
is invoked.

Because element variables are floating point values, the application
code must declare the array passed to be the appropriate type
(float or double) to match the compute word size passed in
ex_create() or ex_open().

\return In case of an error, ex_get_elem_var() returns a negative
number; a warning will return a positive number. Possible causes of
errors include:
  -  data file not properly opened with call to ex_create() or ex_open()
  -  variable does not exist for the desired element block.
  -  invalid element block.


\param[in] exoid            exodus file ID returned from a previous call to
ex_create() or ex_open().
\param[in] time_step        The time step number, as described under
ex_put_time(), at
                            which the element variable values are desired. This
is essentially an
                            index (in the time dimension) into the element
variable values array
                            stored in the database. The first time step is 1.

\param[in] elem_var_index   The index of the desired element variable. The first
variable
                            has an index of 1.

\param[in] elem_blk_id      The desired element block ID.

\param[in] num_elem_this_blk  The number of elements in this element block.

\param[out] elem_var_vals   Returned array of num_elem_this_blk values of the
elem_var_index
                            element variable for the element block with ID of
                            elem_blk_id at the time_step time step.


As an example, the following code segment will read the
var_index-th element variable at one time step stored in an exodus
file :

~~~{.c}
int *ids, num_elem_blk, error, exoid, *num_elem_in_block,
    step, var_ind;

float *var_vals;

ids = (int *) calloc(num_elem_blk, sizeof(int));
error = ex_get_elem_blk_ids (exoid, ids);

step = 1; \comment{read at the first time step}
for (i=0; i < num_elem_blk; i++) {
   var_vals = (float *) calloc (num_elem_in_block[i], sizeof(float));
   error = ex_get_elem_var (exoid, step, var_ind, ids[i],
                            num_elem_in_block[i], var_vals);

\comment{Using non-deprecated function:}
   error = ex_get_var (exoid, step, EX_ELEM_BLOCK, var_ind, ids[i],
                            num_elem_in_block[i], var_vals);

   free (var_values);
}
