/// @brief Allows object modules included in the application to perform various registration
/// operations after main() has been called.
///
/// Most products need to register with other products to provide information such as product
/// version, command line option, and diagnostic writers.  The Bootstrap class provides a safe
/// mechanism for these registrations to occur.
///
/// Bootstrapping occurs in two steps and requires two components, a callback function and a static
/// bootstrap object.  The construction of the static bootstrap object registers the callback
/// function for later execution by main() and the callback function performs registrations such as
/// registering product information, command line options and diagnostics writers.
///
/// By utilizing this mechanism, any modules which need to be bootstrapped can do so by being linked
/// into the executable.
///
/// \anchor stk_util_bootstrap_howto_bootstrap
/// For example:
///
/// \code
/// #include <stk_util/util/Bootstrap.hpp>
/// 
/// namespace {
/// 
/// void bootstrap()
/// {
/// }
/// 
/// stk::Bootstrap x(&bootstrap);
/// 
/// } // namespace <empty>
///
/// \endcode
///
/// Main contains the following function which executes the registered bootstrap functions.
///
/// \code
///
/// int
/// main()
/// {
///   stk::Bootstrap::bootstrap();
///
/// }
///
/// \endcode
///
///
/// The applications main executes the bootstrap functions causing the command line
/// description to be fully populated.
