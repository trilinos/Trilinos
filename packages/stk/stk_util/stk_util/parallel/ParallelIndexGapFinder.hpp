  //  Take a list vector of 'in use' indexes on each processor.  Purpose of this routine is to find a 
  //  set of indexes of the given size that are not used by any current process
  //
  //  Arguments:
  //    minId              : input  : Minimum available id, all returnIds will be greater than or equal to this
  //    maxId              : input  : Maximum number of available id, all returnIds will be less than this number
  //    localIdsInUse      : input  : List of ids currently in use by this processor.  Note, overlap 
  //                                  of this array between processors is allowed, but optimal performance
  //                                  will occur with no overlap
  //    globalNumIdsNeeded : input  : Num of ids required ids on all processors
  //    returnIds          : output : Global consistent list of available ids generated
  //
  //  Returns:  An MPI error code, 0 if correct
