 * @par Product Registry
 *   These 'C' functions support a registry of products
 *   that are linked into an application.  Each product
 *   has a name, version, and optional qualifier.
 *   Re-registration of products is permitted; however,
 *   the second and subsequent registrations must be
 *   identical to the first registration.  The product
 *   registry may be searched and iterated.
 *
 * @par Why 'C' instead of 'C++'
 *   As a general utility this simple product registry may
 *   be called from C++, C, or even FORTRAN.
