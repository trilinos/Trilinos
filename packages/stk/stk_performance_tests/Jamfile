#    * "main-target-name" is the name used to request the target
#            on command line and to use it from other main targets.
#            Main target name may contain alphanumeric characters and symbols '-' and '_';
#    * "sources" is the list of source files and other main targets that must be combined.
#    * "requirements" is the list of properties that must always be present
#            when this main target is built.
#    * "default-build" is the list of properties that will be used unless
#            some other value of the same feature is already specified.
#    * "usage-requirements" is the list of properties that will be propagated
#            to all main targets that use this one, i.e. to all dependedents.
