Ioss Field
  - raw_storage() gives the VariableType* of the data
  - raw_count() gives the number of element of the raw_storage() type
  - get_type() returns a BasicType, which is the type of the underlying data array? (and raw_storage gives the type Ioss interprets that raw data as)
  - get_field_data() method taking a vector<T> resizes the vector to
    raw_count() * variable_type()->component_count() and
    calls internal_get_field_data with vector.data() to read
    sizeof(T) * raw_count() * variable_type()->component_count()
    bytes of data.  So it assumes T is the type described by
    the VariableType
  - Prefer to use the get_type() function to get an enum of the real type
    - the enum values are REAL==DOUBLE=1, INTEGER = INT32=4, INT64=8
    - This type may be different than the raw_storage() type given above
      (I think because Exodus only really supports double fields, so Ioss
       reinterprets the bits as double, and then handles converting them
       back to the original type in the reader)

VariableType
  - component_count(): gives the number of scalars in one element

One thing that is missing is the size (in bytes) of one scalar


For volume blocks:
  - the "ids" field gives the global ids of the elements in each block
  - "implicit_ids" looks the same as "ids"?

For side sets:
  - "ids" field exists, but is empty
  - no other fields

For side block
  - have connectivity, distribution_factors, element_side, and ids fields
  - not sure what the data in "ids" is.  Maybe face numbers?
  - connectivity: maybe connectivity of the faces?
  - element_side: data from elem_ss and side_ss, returns pairs of
    (element gid, local face idx) flattened into an array
