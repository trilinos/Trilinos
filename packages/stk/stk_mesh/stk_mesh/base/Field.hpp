 *  \brief  Field with defined data type and multi-dimensions (if any)
 *
 * Conceptually, a field describes computational data that is associated with
 * mesh entities. The data is not related to connectivity or mesh structure; rather,
 * it is used to track some property (like velocity) that is relevant to the
 * problem being solved.
 *
 * A field specification has three components
 *   - Field type: Defines the type of this field's data. This can be scalar or multidimensional.
 *     If multidimensional (dimensions >= 1), a specification of each dimension will need
 *     to be provided in the form of a shards::ArrayDimTag. Many common ArrayDimTags are defined
 *     in stk_mesh/base/CoordinateSystems.hpp, but apps are free to define their own as well.
 *     - Examples:
 *       - A scalar double field-type:
 *           stk::mesh::Field<double>
 *       - A vector field type using the Cartesian array-dim-tag from CoordinateSystems:
 *           stk::mesh::Field<double, stk::mesh::Cartesian>
 *
 *   - Field declaration: Defines/creates a specific field of a specified type. The API for
 *     declaring fields is in MetaData. Declaration of a field requires a field-type,
 *     field name, and number of states. The number of states defines the "memory" of the Field;
 *     if number-of-states is N, the last N values of the field are stored, and the user
 *     can advance/rotate the states by calling BulkData::update_field_data_states(). FieldState.hpp
 *     contains an enum that clients should use to refer to the various states.
 *     - Examples:
 *       typedef stk::mesh::Field<double, stk::mesh::Cartesian>  CoordFieldType;
 *       CoordFieldType& coord_field = meta.declare_field<CoordFieldType>("<name>", <num_states>);
 *
 *   - Field restrictions: Defines the set of entities that have a field and the dimensions of the
 *     field (maximum of 7 dimensions).  FieldRestrictions are applied to Parts and entities pick
 *     up the field by being placed in the associated part. Also, FieldRestrictions allow the same
 *     Field to be applied to different ranks of entities. E.g., you could apply a velocity Field
 *     to both Faces and Edges through two different FieldRestrictions for each of the different ranks.
 *     Also, FieldRestrictions can apply a nodal field to all nodes in an element ranked part. This
 *     depends on the concept of induced part membership since you can't put a node directly in an
 *     element ranked part, but any nodes reachable through downward relations from elements that are
 *     in the part will be induced into the part and therefore pick up the field. This allows you to
 *     specify special nodal fields for different element types.
 *
 *     The public API for declaring field restrictions is in MetaData.hpp;
 *     we strongly recommend using the put_field free functions to create your field restrictions. A
 *     field may have many restrictions, but the restrictions have to be compatible with each other;
 *     restrictions can overlap if an entity is a member of two parts A,B and you declare restrictions
 *     for a field for both A and B. If such a situation arises, the dimensionality of both restrictions
 *     must be identical.
 *     - Examples:
 *       - Put a scalar field on all nodes in a part
 *           typedef stk::mesh::Field<double>  ScalarFieldType;
 *           ScalarFieldType& field = meta.declare_field<ScalarFieldType>("<name>", <num_states>);
 *           stk::mesh::put_field_on_mesh(field, stk::topology::NODE_RANK, <part>);
 *
 *       - Put a 1d (of size 3) field of doubles on all nodes in a part
 *           typedef stk::mesh::Field<double, stk::mesh::Cartesian3d>  CoordFieldType;
 *           CoordFieldType& field = meta.declare_field<CoordFieldType>("<name>", <num_states>);
 *           stk::mesh::put_field_on_mesh(field, stk::topology::NODE_RANK, <part>, Cartesian3d::Size);
 *
 *       - Put a 2d (of sizes 3 and 3) field of doubles on all nodes in a part
 *           typedef stk::mesh::Field<double, stk::mesh::Cartesian3d, stk::mesh::Cartesian3d> MultiDimFieldType;
 *           MultiFieldType& field = meta.declare_field<MultiFieldType>("<name>", <num_states>);
 *           stk::mesh::put_field_on_mesh(field, stk::topology::NODE_RANK, <part>, Cartesian3d::Size, Cartesian3d::Size);

// Implementation Details:
// The template arguments below describe the field type. Scalar is the scalar
// type of data contained by the field. The TagN describe each dimension of the
// Field, these are expected to be ArrayDimTags. Unused dimensions can be ignored.
