  AztecOO will solve a linear systems of equations: \f$ AX=B \f$, using Epetra

  //! Method to set options/parameters using a ParameterList object.
  /*! This method extracts any mixture of options and parameters from a
    ParameterList object and uses them to set values in AztecOO's internal
    options and params arrays.
    This method may be called repeatedly. This method does not reset default
    values or previously-set values unless those values are contained in the
    current ParameterList argument. Note that if the method SetAztecDefaults()
    is called after this method has been called, any parameters set by this
    method will be lost.

    A ParameterList is a collection of named ParameterEntry objects. AztecOO
    recognizes names which mirror the macros defined in az_aztec_defs.h. In
    addition, it recognizes case insensitive versions of those names, with or
    without the prepended 'AZ_'. So the following are equivalent and valid:
    "AZ_solver", "SOLVER", "Solver". To set an entry in the Aztec options
    array, the type of the ParameterEntry value may be either a string or an int
    in some cases. E.g., if selecting the solver, the following are equivalent
    and valid: AZ_gmres (which is an int), "AZ_gmres" (which is a string) or
    "GMRES" (case-insensitive, 'AZ_' is optional).

    To set an entry in the Aztec params array, the type of the
    ParameterEntry value must be double.

    By default, this method will silently ignore parameters which have
    unrecognized names or invalid types. Users may set the optional argument
    specifying that warnings be printed for unused parameters. Alternatively,
    users may iterate the ParameterList afterwards and check the isUsed
    attribute on the ParameterEntry objects.

    @param parameterlist Object containing parameters to be parsed by AztecOO.
    @param cerr_warning_if_unused Optional argument, default value is false.
        If true, a warning is printed to cerr stating which parameters are
        not used due to having unrecognized names or values of the wrong type.
        Default behavior is to silently ignore unused parameters.
