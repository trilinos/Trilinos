#      This parameter names the subdirectory from which the script is being

#      by script owner.

## Different directory structures will require different setups.
## This file assumes a structure like that of epetra - exe's live in 
## a direct subdirectory of 'epetra/test' 

## Keep in mind that file and file2-4 live in 'package_name/test'
## Also, 'package_name/test' is the current directory
## It is recommended that all directory changing be done relative to
## the current directory because scripts live in the source directory,
## but are invoked from various build directories

## List the subdirectories of 'test' containing test exe's in the foreach loop
## if directory structure is like that of epetra.
