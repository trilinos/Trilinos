# notes
#
# - Overview: This script is intended to be very much like mlbench used to be.
#   A subset of ml/examples is built and run with a variety
#   of inputs and compared against saved results.  Significant differences mean
#   an error has occurred.
#
# - Invocation: In build area, 'cd ml/test'.
#               scripts/daily/mpi/TestML_Examples True True
#               Look at results in ../../../../logLinux.txt
#
# - This script will call all *.csh scripts found in TEST_SUBDIRS.
#
# - The *.csh scripts run test executables based on examples in ml/examples.
#
# - The *.csh test fails if it prints *anything* to stdout or stderror.
#   (Look in ml/${TEST_SUBDIRS} at the .csh scripts to see how we decide
#   if a run has failed.)
#
# - If a *.csh test fails, it gets called again with the "-v" flag to get
#   verbose output, which gets emailed to everyone in OWNERS.

# $1 - Used only for automated testing.  No action required by script owner.
#      This parameter names the subdirectory from which the script is being
#      run.  This assists a developer in figuring out which tests failed.
# $2 - Indicates if the test is an automated nightly test.  No action required
#      by script owner.

## Different directory structures will require different setups.
## This file assumes a structure like that of epetra - exe's live in 
## a direct subdirectory of 'epetra/test' 

## Keep in mind that file and file2-4 live in 'package_name/test'
## Also, 'package_name/test' is the current directory
## It is recommended that all directory changing be done relative to
## the current directory because scripts live in the source directory,
## but are invoked from various build directories

## List the subdirectories of 'test' containing test exe's in the foreach loop
## if directory structure is like that of epetra.

# here, the pwd is ml/test
#foreach f ( 2d_Poisson )
foreach f ( ${TEST_SUBDIRS} )

            # so instead I chose just to pipe directly to file4.
		    #( $g > ../$file3 ) >>& ../$file4
		    $g >>& ../$file4
		    if(! -z ../$file4 ) then
