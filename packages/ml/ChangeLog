Overview of main ML changes from ml-2.0 to ml-3.0
-------------------------------------------------
	
The ML version contains in Trilinos 4.0 has been enhanced with respect
to the one included in the Trilinos 3.1 distribution as follows:

- ML presents an improved interface to C++. Two new classes have been
introduced to use ML as a preconditioner for Epetra_LinearProblem (both
in the ML_Epetra namespace): MultiLevelOperator and
MultiLevelPreconditioner. ML can be used as a black-box solver to define
multilevel (possibly domain decomposition based) preconditioners for
Epetra_RowMatrix. The user provides only the linear system matrix, and
all the parameters defining the preconditioners, specified in a Teuchos
parameters list.

- ML uses Teuchos if class ML_Epetra::MultiLevelPreconditioner, and in
some other internal classes.

- ML now supports the Trilinos package Amesos as primary direct
sequential and parallel direct solvers. Through Amesos, KLU, UMFPACK
4.1, SuperLU_DIST 2.0, MUMPS 4.3.1, and ScaLAPACK can be used. The user can
specify the maximum number of processes to be used in the coarse
solution.

- ML interface to SuperLU and SuperLU_DIST is now deprecated in favor of
the Amesos one.

- ML now implements and interfaces to the Trilinos package
Anasazi. Anasazi can be used to estimate the maximum eigenvalue for both
symmetric and non-symmetric problems.

- Two new aggregation schemes, based on graph partitioning algorithms,
have been added. To that aim, third-party libraries METIS and ParMETIS
can be used. ML must be configured with options --with-ml_metis and
--with-ml_parmetis_3x to use graph partitioning algorithms to create the
aggregates. (ParMETIS requires Epetra support).

- A basic interface to the Trilinos package IFPACK is now included.

- ML can use a simple power method to estimate lambda max for
non-symmetric problems.

- The set of examples has been extended. Now about 30 examples are available.

- Improved the MLS preconditioner for block systems.

- In the configuration phase, ML automatically recognizes which Trilinos
package has been enabled, and compiles all functions sing this package (if any).

- A new user's guide is available in the doc subdirectory.

- (Limited) doxygen documentation is available. Type doxygen in the doc
subdirectory. Almost all C++ code, and part of the C code, has been
modified with doxygen-compatible comments.

==============================================================================
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
May 2004 (current version 3.0, distributed with Trilinos 4.0)

	* Update the ml user's guide (in the doc subdirectory)
	* Improved interface to C++. Introduced two classes to use
	  ML as a preconditioner for Epetra_LinearProblem (both in the
	  ML_Epetra namespace): MultiLevelOperator and 
	  MultiLevelPreconditioner.
	* Basic feaures to solve Maxwell equations via MultiLevelPreconditioner
	  are now supported
	* Improved interface to Amesos. Now ML can use Anasazi to estimate
	  the maximum eigenvalue for both symmetric and non-symmetric
	  problems.
	* Improve interface to Anasazi
	* Add power method to estimate lambda max for non-syymmetric
	  problems
	* Improve the MLS preconditioner for block systems
	* New options for configure. Drop --with-ml_epetra (and similar
	  for other Trilinos packages), and use --enable-epetra (and similar)
	* Fixed various compiler warnings for LINUX (GNU and Intel),
	  SGI 64, DEC, west-cplant, ASCI Red

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apr 2004
	
	* Change to support new Teuchos methods' name
	* Change to support new Amesos methods' name
	* Now support to ML native interface to SuperLU and SuperLUDIST
	  is deprecated in favor of Amesos interface
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jan 2004
	
	* Add METIS and ParMETIS aggregation schemes
	* Add Teuchos support
	* Add interface to Amesos
	* Add interface to IFPACK
	* Add interface to Anasazi
	* Add configure options --with-ml_epetra, --with-ml_parmetis2x,
	  --with-ml_parmetis3x, --with-ml_ifpack, --with-ml_anasazi
	* Add two-level additive and hybrid domain decomposition
	  preconditioners (not officially supported)
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
Sep 2003 (version 2.0, distributed with Trilinos 3.1)
	
	* ML has now been put "autotooled", i.e., autoconf and automake.
    	* Haim Waisman's GGB method has been implemented.
    	* Bill Cochran's cache optimizations for multiple RHSs have been 
	  implemented.
    	* Bill also has added code so that ML will compile with c++ compilers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
ml2_1_0_0-branch-patch_1
	
	* 1st patch for release ml2_1_0_0 (trilinos-release-3-01-branch).
	* Bug fix for eigenvalue estimate that was causing Alegra 
	  sinmag benchmark to fail.
	* Added definitions for make macro CXX in architecture-dependent 
	  makefiles in order for Alegra to be able to build epetra interfaces.
	* Minor changes to block matrix (equivalent real form)
	  capabilities.
	* Fixed compiler warnings.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
mystring = ml2_1_0_0

	* Many minor fixes to get the commuting relationship T_h P_n = P_e T_H
	  exactly right.
	* Serial implementation of enriched prolongator.
	* New norm for convergence of Maxwell solver.  This norm measure
	  and scales properly the range space and null space components of
	  the (curl,curl) operator.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
mystring = ml2_0_0_5

	* Changes in aggregation post-processing to improve aggregate quality.
	* Added wrappers so that ML can use Epetra objects & so that 
	  AztecOO can use ML as a preconditioner.
	* Added block Maxwell capabilities for real block systems that are
	  equivalent to the complex systems arising from Maxwell in the 
	  frequency domain.
	
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
mystring = ml2_0_0_3

	* Added in smoothing of Reitzinger/Schoeberl prolongator.
	* Least squares and smoothed l.s. prolongators in serial for R/S AMG.
	* Enhanced detection of degenerate coarse grid matrices in building
	  R/S AMG hierarchy.

	* Symmetrize Hiptmair smoother and finished off MLS within Hiptmair. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
ml2_0_0_1 

	* MLS polynomial smoother
        * matrix does not need to be scaled.
     	* Added more print control:
	  - "ml_inputfile" now takes an additional argument in the general
	  - problem specs section:
	  - "Print Level = [an integer]"
	  - 0 => minimal output
	  - 1 => some output (default)
	  - 2,3,... => increasing amounts of output

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
ml2_0_0_0 

	* AMG for Maxwell's equations
     	* Reitzinger Schoeberl AMG.
     	* Hiptmair smoother.
