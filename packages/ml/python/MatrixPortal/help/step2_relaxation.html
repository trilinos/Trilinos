<h1>Step 2 -- Relaxation Preconditioners</h1>
  
<p>These preconditioners are implemented by the 
<a href=http://software.sandia.gov/trilinos/packages/ifpack>IFPACK</a> library by class
Ifpack_PointRelaxation, whose documentation is available
<a target=_blank href=http://software.sandia.gov/trilinos/packages/docs/dev/packages/ifpack/doc/html/classIfpack__PointRelaxation.html>here</a>.
 
<p>Typically, these preconditioners perform poorly as stand-alone, while they
are quite effective as smoothers in multilevel preconditioners. If you want to
analyze the performances of these preconditioners, first click on <b>Relaxation
Preconditioners</b> to visualize the list of parameters, then set <b>Yes</b> to one or more
of the following: Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, symmetric Gauss-Seidel. You have to
specify two parameters: the number of sweeps and the damping parameter.
