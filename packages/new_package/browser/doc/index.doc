/*! \mainpage New_Package Package Browser (Single Doxygen Collection)

The purpose of this doxygen documentation collection is to allow experienced
developers a quick and easy way to browse all of the New_Package package in a single
doxygen documentation collection.  Most people are better off starting at the
<a href="../../../doc/html/index.html">main New_Package documentation page</a> since
this is where one will find examples and tutorials.
