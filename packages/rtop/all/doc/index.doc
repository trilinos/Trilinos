/*! \mainpage RTOp Package Browser (Single Doxygen Collection)

The purpose of this doxygen documentation collection is to allow experienced
developers a quick and easy way to browse all of the rtop package in a
single doxygen documentation collection.  Most people are better off starting
at the <a href="../../../doc/html/index.html">main RTOp documentation
page</a> since this is where one will find examples and tutorials.
