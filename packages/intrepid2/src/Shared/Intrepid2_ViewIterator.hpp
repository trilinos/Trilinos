  /** \class  Intrepid2::ViewIterator
      \brief  A helper class that allows iteration over some part of a Kokkos View, while allowing
              the calling code to remain agnostic as to the rank of the view.
   
   Usage is as follows:
   1. Construct ViewIterator from View.
   2. Use the setLocation() method to set the location appropriate to each thread.
   3. Use get() to access the current value, set() to set it, and increment() to move to the next entry.
   4. Stop condition: if only part of the View is traversed on a thread, nextIncrementRank(), or the returned rank value from increment(), may be used to determine when the View locations for a given dimension have been traversed.
   
   For example, if a rank-4 View has dimensions (D1,D2,D3,D4) = (10,15,20,25), and logical threads are assigned to each (D1,D2) pair,
   then each thread would call setLocation({D1,D2,0,0,0,0,0}), and would stop traversal when increment() returned 1, indicating that
   the D2 rank had been incremented, which in turn would imply that all (D3,D4) pairs had been visited.
   
      @see Intrepid2::TensorViewIterator

      \remark This class is under active development; its interface should be understood to be in flux.
              Furthermore, this may eventually move to another Trilinos package.
