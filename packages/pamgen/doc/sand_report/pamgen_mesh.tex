\section{Capabilities}\label{sec:caps}
The capabilities of \textsc{pamgen} are best understood by studying Section ~\ref{sec:specifying_a_mesh}, which documents in detail the instructions available for specifying a mesh. This section provides a brief overview of the library's capabilities. \textsc{pamgen} will be distributed as part of the \textsc{Trilinos} package of matrix and finite element tools.

\subsection{Dimensions}
\textsc{pamgen} can create both two and three dimensional meshes. It creates quadrilateral finite element meshes if two dimensions are specified, and it creates hexahedral finite element meshes if three dimensions are specified. For two dimensional quadrilateral meshes the Z component of nodal coordinates is not supplied.

\subsection{Mesh Geometries}

The \textsc{pamgen} library handles the mesh geometries shown below:
\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
\item Bricks
\item Partial hollow cylinders
\item Complete hollow cylinders
\item Partial solid cylinders
\item Complete solid cylinders
\end{itemize}


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
      \includegraphics[width=1.0in]{brick}
      \includegraphics[width=1.0in]{cubit_radial1}
      \includegraphics[width=1.0in]{cubit_radial2}
      \includegraphics[width=1.0in]{cubit_radial_trisection}
      \includegraphics[width=1.0in]{cubit_radial_trisection2}
  \caption{The mesh geometry zoo in 3D.}
  \label{fig:btm}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Boundary Conditions}
Boundary conditions application regions in the form of node sets and side sets can be applied to the face, edge, or corner of any element block in the finite element mesh. They may also be applied to any face, edge, or corner of the entire mesh.
\subsection{Decomposition}
There are several mesh decomposition strategies available in \textsc{pamgen}:
\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
\item A default decomposition based on a constrained optimized solution that slices through the entire mesh in its three (or two in 2D) topological dimensions.
\item A user defined slicing strategy that specifies the number of slices through the mesh in each topological direction.
\item A sequential strategy that distributes elements beetween processors based on their element ids with the first n  elements going to processor 0 ...
\item A random strategy that assigns element to processors randomly.
\end{itemize}

\subsection {Geometry Transformation}
Any mesh can be modified by re-evaluating the nodal coordinate values using a user-supplied function. This function has the original nodal coordinates as input values. Its output values define the new nodal coordinates.



\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
      \includegraphics[width=1.0in]{3d_warped_geometry_white_bg}
      \includegraphics[width=1.0in]{mesh_warp_2d_white_bg}
  \caption{Examples of geometry transformation.}
  \label{fig:btm}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Element Density}
Several of the geometry types allow specification of first and last element sizes within a block in a particular cartesian direction. In addition the user may control node distribution over any geometry by providing a user defined distribution function. This function is evaluated so that nodes are shifted towards areas where the function has its highest values.

\section{Approach}\label{sec:challenge}
\textsc{pamgen} operates on the premise that mesh generation is deterministic. This means that every execution of code compiled with compiler A and run on processor B under operating system C reading mesh instructions file D will produce an identical mesh. The mesh will have the same topology and the nodes will have the same coordinate locations.  On a multi-processor machine of identical nodes an arbitrary number of processors executing identical instructions produce an identical mesh. Use of \textsc{pamgen} on heterogeneous machines may produce unexpected results.

With one significant exception, \textsc{pamgen} operates in the same way as these identical processors producing identical mesh. The exception is that each processor only allocates for a subset of the nodes and elements, and each processor performs topology and geometry calculations only for the entities and dependencies present on that processor.  \textsc{pamgen} exploits the fact that each processor is capable of producing the entire mesh in order to allow each processor to produce its own mesh. The deterministic nature of the meshing process is essential to allow correspondence in topologies and geometries produced on adjacent processors.

The implementation of the mesh generation in \textsc{pamgen} is as much as possible implicit. Quantities are not allocated until they are ready for output, and they are not calculated until they can be stored, or until they are required by a dependent calculation. This approach can result in duplication of intermediate calculations, but it avoids the severe limitations on total problem size that occur if attempts are made to allocate any quantity with a size related to the total mesh size.

\section{Usage}\label{sec:usage}
For the few simple geometries and element types it supports, the \textsc{pamgen} library is a substitute for pre-processed finite element mesh files.  Successful usage of the library requires some modification of the analysis code. 

The \textsc{pamgen} library must be linked into the analysis executable to allow access to the mesh creation, query and deletion functions.

The modules in the analysis code that read finite element mesh data from a file must be adapted to:
\begin{itemize}\addtolength{\itemsep}{-0.5\baselineskip}
\item Read in a ``C''-progamming language string that specifices the geometry, topology, and boundary conditions of a mesh.
\item Pass that string to the \textsc{pamgen} Create\_Pamgen\_Mesh(...) function along with the rank of the mesh requested and the total number of processors across which the mesh is spread. 
\item Handle message and possibly error strings available after calling Create\_Pamgen\_Mesh(...).
\item Call the \textsc{pamgen} query functions to populate the analysis code's mesh and communication data structures.
\item Call the \textsc{pamgen} Delete\_Pamgen\_Mesh() function release memory allocated within the library.
\end{itemize}

The source code for a stand-alone executable called ``pamgen\_lt\_c'' is distributed with the \textsc{pamgen} library. This example code is an excellent starting point for adapting an analysis code to use the \textsc{pamgen} library.

\section{Specifying a Mesh}\label{sec:specifying_a_mesh}

The ``C''-programming language string passed to \textsc{pamgen} is the complete definition of the mesh's geometry, topology, node sets, side sets, and parallel decomposition. It must begin with a \texttt{MESH} keyword, and it must end with an \texttt{END} keyword. The \texttt{MESH -- END} keyword pair must surround a \texttt{RECTILINEAR --
END}, \texttt{SPHERICAL -- END}, \texttt{BRICK -- END}, \texttt{RADIAL -- END}, \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION -- END}, or \texttt{CYLINDRICAL -- END}
keyword pair and may have additional \texttt{SET ASSIGN -- END}, \texttt{DECOMPOSITION STRATEGY -- END},
\texttt{USER DEFINED ELEMENT DENSITY -- END}, or \texttt{USER DEFINED GEOMETRY TRANSFORMATION -- END} keyword pairs.

{\ttfamily \begin{verbatim}

   END
  [SET ASSIGN]

  [DECOMPOSITION STRATEGY]
  [END]
  [USER DEFINED GEOMETRY TRANSFORMATION]
  [END]
  [USER DEFINED ELEMENT DENSITY]
  [END]
END
\end{verbatim}
}

\subsection{Dimensionality}
\label{sec:dimensionality}
\index{Dimensionality}
The dimensionality of the mesh is not specified in the ``C'' programming language string. It is passed to the \textsc{pamgen} library at execution time through the \textsc{pamgen} API.  In general a 2D mesh can be specified by removing 3D specific keywords and values (those referencing a third coordinate [for example Z or k]) from a 3D mesh description. 

\subsection{Block IDs}
\label{sec:blockids}
\index{Block IDs}
The finite elements created using \textsc{pamgen} are grouped into blocks. Each block has a positive non-zero id.  These ids are automatically assigned by \textsc{pamgen} and are not under the control of the user. If there is a single block then its id is 1. When there are more than  one block, the ids are assigned beginning with the block in the lowest topological position in i, j, k space. Subsequent blocks are incrementally numbered first in the i topological direction, next in the j topological direction, and finally in the k topological direction. In the case of \texttt{BRICK} and \texttt{RECTILINEAR} meshes i, j, and k correspond to the coordinate directions x, y, and z. In the case of \texttt{CYLINDRICAL}, \texttt{RADIAL}, and \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION} meshes i, j, and k correspond to r, $\theta$, and z.

The \texttt{RECTILINEAR -- END} block pair surrounds the description

of the domain is given by a pair of vectors (gmin and gmax).  The
number of blocks in each coordinate direction and the number of

number of elements specified in this type of mesh is the
product of the total number of blocks \texttt{BX} $\times$ \texttt{BY}
$\times$ \texttt{BZ} and the total number of elements per block
\texttt{NX} $\times$ \texttt{NY} $\times$ \texttt{NZ}.  For a 2D mesh
\texttt{NZ} and \texttt{BZ} must be omitted.  The keywords associated

}

The \texttt{RADIAL} and \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION} block pairs allow the description of
a
curvilinear cylindrical mesh centered at the origin in x and y, and
aligned along the z-axis.  The \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION -- END}
block pair fills in the center of the cylindrical mesh with transition
elements.  These options are similar to the \texttt{CYLINDRICAL}
but they have a different set of controls on element distribution.  The
successful creation of these meshes requires sequential
specification of the information for the number of elements blocks and
their sizes in each coordinate direction. 

The \texttt{ENFORCE PERIODICITY} keyword applies only to \texttt{RADIAL} and \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION} mesh descriptions that meet certain requirements: 
\begin{itemize}
  	\item The meshes must have azimuthal angles of 90, 180, or 360 degrees.
	\item The meshes must have a single block of elements in the azimuthal direction. 
	\item The meshes must have an even number of elements in each 90 degree segment of the mesh. 
	\item For \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION} meshes, one transition zone is required for each 90 degrees of azimuth. 
\end{itemize} 

This keyword causes the mesh generation to perform all node coordinate calculations in the first 45 degrees of the azimuthal domain. Coordinate locations of nodes ouside of 45 degrees are formed by permuting the sign and oder of the components of periodically corresponding nodes' locations. This guarantees that there will be no differences between the absolute floating point values of periodically corresponding nodes' coordinates.  

The \texttt{NUMZ | NUMR | NUMA} keywords are followed by an integer
specifying the number
of element blocks in that coordinate direction. The
\texttt{NUMR} line includes an additional real parameter that
specifies the inner radius of the cylindrical mesh. Specification of
an inner radius of 0.0 will result in degenerate elements with
co-located nodes along the \texttt{Z} axis. The innner radius
specification is ignored for \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION} meshes.

Immediately following
the \texttt{NUMZ int | NUMR int INITIAL RADIUS real | NUMA int} lines, there must be a \texttt{ZBLOCK |
  RBLOCK | ABLOCK} line for each of the blocks in that direction.
These lines specify the spatial extent of the particular block and the
distribution of elements in the block in that direction. The \texttt{INTERVAL int} keyword
specifies a fixed number of elements in the
block. A \texttt{FIRST SIZE real LAST SIZE real} pair specifies the absolute
size of the first and last elements in the block. When the \texttt{FIRST SIZE real LAST SIZE real} specification is
used, the element sizing will be linear between the first and last
elements. The sizes of the first and last elements may be
adjusted slightly to provide linear sizing. The approximate number of elements that will be generated using \texttt{FIRST SIZE} and \texttt{LAST SIZE} sizing controls is given by truncating to an integer, the length of the mesh segment divided by the average of the \texttt{FIRST SIZE} and \texttt {LAST SIZE} values. There is a slight chance that this calculation will result in a different number of elements on different computer platforms.  Omission of the
\texttt{LAST real} keyword is equivalent to setting the element size
to that given by the \texttt{FIRST SIZE real} keyword.

The \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION -- END} block pair requires the
additional input of \texttt{TRISECTION BLOCKS, int} and it accepts the
optional \texttt{TRANSITION RADIUS, real} keyword value pair.  The
\texttt{TRISECTION BLOCKS} keyword specifies the number of transition
zones that will be used in the central region of the mesh. This
number must be supplied. One transition zone is recommended for each
90 degrees of azimuth.  The \texttt{TRANSITION RADIUS} is the distance
from the origin to the corners of the transition zones of
mesh. Without this parameter the transition radius is chosen to be one
half of the radial thickness of the first block.  When \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION} is selected, any \texttt{INITIAL RADIUS} supplied is
  ignored.

The \texttt{ZMIN real} keyword value pair is available to specify an offset for the
entire mesh in the \texttt{Z} direction.

If the cumulative values of the sizes of the azimuthal blocks, given
by the second argument of \texttt{ABLOCK int real} is equal to 360.0 degrees, then the mesh
will form an single closed ring of elements.

The \texttt{BRICK} mesh topology type is a more flexible version of the \texttt{RECTILINEAR} type in that it allows different numbers of elements in each element block in each coordinate direction. The creation of a
\texttt{BRICK} mesh is analogous to the \texttt{RADIAL} mesh option
and
successful creation of these meshes requires sequential
specification of the information for the number of elements blocks and
their sizes in each coordinate direction. 

The \texttt{NUMX | NUMY | NUMZ} keywords are followed by an integer
specifying the number
of element blocks in that coordinate direction. The

Immediately following
the \texttt{NUMX int | NUMY int | NUMZ int} lines, there must be a \texttt{XBLOCK |
  YBLOCK | ZBLOCK} line for each of the blocks in that direction. The first integer on  this line corresponds to the ordinal (beginning with 1) of the line.
These lines specify the spatial extent of the particular block and the
distribution of elements in the block in that direction. The \texttt{INTERVAL int} keyword
specifies a fixed number of elements in the
block. A \texttt{FIRST SIZE real LAST SIZE real} pair specifies the absolute
size of the first and last elements in the block. When the \texttt{FIRST SIZE real LAST SIZE real} specification is
used, the element sizing will be linear between the first and last
elements. The sizes of the first and last elements may be
adjusted slightly to provide linear sizing. Omission of the
\texttt{LAST real} keyword is equivalent to setting the element size
to that given by the \texttt{FIRST SIZE real} keyword.


An example of a \textsc{pamgen} mesh definition with the
\texttt{BRICK} option is illustrated in

END
\end{verbatim}
}

The \texttt{SET ASSIGN -- END} keyword pair allows the specification
of nodesets and sidesets on the exterior of meshes.  These
nodesets and sidesets can be used for specifying boundary conditions
on the domain. The nodeset or sideset is applied to the topological
face, edge, or vertex associated with the prescribed topological
direction. The mesh domain topology and associated labels are
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:set_assign_topology}.This specification
applies to the entire  domain and cannot be used to
specifiy individual blocks.

The most commonly used sub-domains are the exterior faces of the
domain. They can be prescribed using \textsc {IHI, JHI, KHI, ILO,
JLO,} or \textsc {KLO}. For RECTILINEAR meshes \textsc {I,J,} and
\textsc {K} correspond to the coordinate directions x, y, and z. For
SPHERICAL meshes \textsc {I,J,} and \textsc {K} correspond to the
coordinate directions r, $\theta$, and $\phi$. For CYLINDRICAL meshes \textsc
{I,J,} and \textsc {K} correspond to the coordinate directions r,
$\theta$, and z.  The \textsc {KHI, KLO} options do not exist in two
dimension simulations.

The \textsc{ALL} option for nodesets places all the nodes of the mesh in a 
nodeset with the requested id. The \textsc{ALL} option is not available for 
sidesets.

Specifying a nodeset on the \textsc{ILO} face of a \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION} mesh 
refers to the edge aligned with the Z axis (see Figure~\ref{fig:block_ss}). 
Sidesets may not be  specified on the \textsc{ILO} face of 
\texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION} meshes.

\emph{BLOCK NODESETS and BLOCK SIDESETS are only available to the BRICK,
RADIAL, and  RADIAL TRISECTION geometry mesh types.}

The \texttt{  [{BLOCK SIDESET | BLOCK NODESET},{ IHI | JHI | KHI | ILO | JLO |
KLO }, int, int]} command allows specification of nodesets and
sidesets on the topological faces of blocks that may be within the
finite element mesh. The first integer specifies the id that the
sideset or nodeset will have, the second integer specifies the block
on which the sideset or nodeset is applied.

An example of \texttt{BLOCK SIDESET} applied to a mesh definition with the
\texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION} option is illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:block_ss}. In this example a sidet is applied to the
\texttt{IHI} face of block 2. The sideset applied to block 2 will
have sideset id 45. The faces called out in these sidesets will have
outward normals facing in the \texttt{IHI} direction.

} 

The \texttt{USER DEFINED GEOMETRY TRANSFORMATION -- END} keyword pair provides
a powerful way to modify the coordinats of any node of a mesh. The keyword-end
pair must surround a double quote surrounded block of `C' code. This code will be called with coordinates of every node in the mesh. It may modify the the coordinats by setting the output variables \texttt{outxcoord}, \texttt{outycoord}, and \texttt{outzcoord}. The unmodified values of the node's coordinates are available in the input variables \texttt{inxcoord}, \texttt{inycoord}, and \texttt{inzcoord}.  The coordinates will remain unchanged if the output variables are not modified.  A presentation of the capabilities and
limitations of runtime compiled 'C' functions is included in
Appendix~\ref{sec:runtime-compiler-functionality}.

Examples of meshes produced using this capability feature of \textsc{pamgen} are shown below in Figure~\ref{fig:3d_transform_example} and Figure~\ref{fig:2d_transform_example}. In the first example the nodes with positive Z coordinate values are rotated about the Z axis an angle propportional to their distance from the Z=0 plane. In the second example nodes a distance of 0.5 from the origin are rotated about the origin in proportion to their distance from the origin.

USER DEFINED ELEMENT DENSITY, {I|J|K} 
  "
    user supplied `C' language instructions;

END
\end{verbatim}
} 

The \texttt{USER DEFINED ELEMENT DENSITY -- END} keyword pair provides
a flexible way to bias \texttt{RECTILINEAR},
\texttt{SPHERICAL}, and \texttt{CYLINDRICAL} meshes. The keyword-end
pair must surround a double quote surrounded block of `C' code that
evaluates on the input variable \texttt{coord} and sets the return
value \texttt{field}. The return value \texttt{field} must be set to a
positive value across the range of the mesh in the selected
topological direction. A presentation of the capabilities and
limitations of runtime compiled 'C' functions is included in
Appendix~\ref{sec:runtime-compiler-functionality}.

The mesh biasing adjusts the nodal coordinates such that the density
of the elements in a region of the mesh in the selected coordinate
direction is proportional to the value of \texttt{field} relative to
the integral of \texttt{field} across the mesh domain. This is
implemented by numerically solving the equation given below. In this
equation \begin {math} x _ i \end {math} is the coordinate of node
\begin {math} i \end {math}, \begin {math} n \end {math} is the total
number of nodes in the coordinate direction, and \begin {math} f(u)
\end {math} is the user supplied function.

\begin{equation}
   \frac {\int _ {0} ^ {x _ i} f(u)du } {\int _ {0} ^ {x _ n} f(u)du }
   = \frac {i} {n} 
\end{equation}

When these functions are applied to a two dimensional
\texttt{RECTILINEAR} mesh spanning from $(0.0, 0.0)$ to $(1.0, 1.0)$ and
having two blocks and 10 elements in both the 'I', and 'J' directions,
the resulting mesh is graded as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:bias_example}.  The grading is a continuous
exponential function in the 'I' direction and is a discontinuous
function in the 'J' direction. In the 'J' direction the domain
stretching from 0.0 to 0.5 has twice the element density as the range
from 0.5 to 1.0.

Diagnostic information for the user provided functions is included in
the \texttt{runid.out} file.  This information includes the total
integrated value of the function, the minimum and maximum value of the

}

The \texttt{BISECTION} decomposition strategy is the default for parallel calculations. This is
because it is robust in providing decompositions and the resulting
regions have satisfactory surface area to volume ratios. This strategy 
attempts to automatically determine the number of slices to make through 
the entire mesh domain to provide an equal number of elements to each processor. This strategy will be most successful when the number of processors, and the number of elements in each direction are a power of 2 or a product of several prime numbers.

The \texttt{PROCESSOR LAYOUT} decomposition strategy offers the user
improved control of the distribution of elements to each
processor in a parallel simulation. The strategy divides the mesh into the number of segments specified by the keyword-value pair for each coordinate direction. The number of
processors must equal the product of the values given for each of the
\texttt{NUMPROCS} directions. The default value for a coordinate direction is one.  

When using a \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION} mesh the number of processors in the \texttt{I} (radial) direction is fixed at 1, and the total number of processors must be equal to the
product of the values given for the \texttt{J} and \texttt{K}
\texttt{NUMPROCS} directions. For this mesh type the decomposition
assigns elements from the inner transition blocks to the processor
that owns the adjacent elements in the outer cylinderical blocks.
An example of the \texttt{PROCESSOR LAYOUT} decomposition option
applied to a \texttt{RADIAL TRISECTION} mesh is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tri_dec}.

Examples of \texttt{BISECTION} and
\texttt{PROCESSOR LAYOUT} decomposition options applied to a mesh definition with the
\texttt{RADIAL} option are shown below in
Figures~\ref{fig:dec_bis} and
 \ref{fig:dec_pl}. The total
number of elements in this problem was 204, 17 in the radial or
\texttt{I} direction and 12 in the azimuthal or \texttt{J} direction.

For the \texttt{BISECTION} decomposition the recursive cuts made on
the 17x12x1 array of elements results in three processors with 3x12x1 elements,
four processors with 2x12x1
elements and a single processor 6x8x1 elements. 

For the \texttt{PROCESSOR LAYOUT} decomposition the
17 elements in the \texttt{I} or radial direction are divided by 4 to
set the size of segments produced in that direction at 4. The first segment's size is increased by one to handle the remainder of dividing 14 by 4. This decomposition would equally
distribute elements to each processor if the \texttt{I} direction had a number of
elements evenly divisible by 4.

\section{Library Interface}\label{sec:execution_steps}
\subsection{Creating a Mesh}
Mesh creation proceeds through a single function call. Additional functions are available to access messages generated during the mesh creation.
\subsubsection{Create\_Pamgen\_Mesh}
{\ttfamily  \begin{verbatim}
int Create_Pamgen_Mesh( char * file_char_array,
                        int dimension,
                        int rank,
                        int num_procs);
\end{verbatim}}
This function creates a representation of the mesh for the processor of the specified rank out of the total num\_procs. It returns an enumerated value. A return value of \textbf{ERROR\_FREE\_CREATION
} signifies success. A return value of \textbf{ERROR\_CREATING\_IMD} significes an error in the specification of the mesh geometry, topology, or boundary conditions. A return value of \textbf{ERROR\_CREATING\_MS} significes an error in allocating and populating the arrays that store the mesh geometry and topology. A return value of \textbf{ERROR\_PARSING\_DEFINITION} significes an error occurred while parsing the string passed in file\_char\_array. The details of the syntax error are recoverable by subsequent calls.

%\begin{itemize}
{
\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}

 \textbf{char *file\_char\_array}
This input variable points to a null terminated string that holds a terse description of the desired mesh.  This form of this description is given in a later section.

 \textbf{int dimension}
This input variable indicates the dimension of the desired mesh. Acceptable values are 2 (quadrilaterals created in x,y plane) and 3 (hexahedral elements created in 3 space).

 \textbf{int rank}
This input variable may range from 0 to one less than num\_procs. It specifies for which processor the mesh is being generated.

 \textbf{int num\_procs}
This input variable must be greater than 0.  It specifes the total number of processors across which the mesh is decomposed.
}
%\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{getPamgenEchoStreamSize}
{\ttfamily  \begin{verbatim}
int getPamgenEchoStreamSize(void);
\end{verbatim}}

This function returns the size of the string (not counting termination character) that contains an echo of the \textbf{char * file\_char\_array} string previously passed to Create\_Pamgen\_Mesh. If a parsing error occurred, this string will be annotated with a summary of the error. Use of this function and subsequent access and display of this string is highly recommended if the value pointed to by \textbf{int * parse\_error\_count} is non-zero on return. 

\subsubsection{getPamgenEchoStream}
{\ttfamily  \begin{verbatim}
char * getPamgenEchoStream(char * echo_stream_pointer);
\end{verbatim}}
This function takes a character pointer and returns that same pointer after it has been filled.

{\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
 \textbf{char *echo\_stream\_pointer} This input variable must point to allocated memory big enough to hold the the results of ``getEchoStreamSize(void)'' plus a termination character.
}

\subsubsection{getPamgenErrorStreamSize}
{\ttfamily  \begin{verbatim}
int getPamgenErrorStreamSize(void);
\end{verbatim}}

\end{verbatim}}
This function takes a character pointer and returns that same pointer after it has been filled.

{\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
 \textbf{char *error\_stream\_pointer} This input variable must point to allocated memory big enough to hold the the results of getErrorStreamSize plus a termination character.
}


\subsubsection{getPamgenWarningStreamSize}
{\ttfamily  \begin{verbatim}
int getPamgenWarningStreamSize(void);
\end{verbatim}}
This function returns the size of a string containing warnings generated within the Create\_Pamgen\_Mesh function.

\subsubsection{getPamgenWarningStream}
{\ttfamily  \begin{verbatim}
char * getPamgenWarningStream(char * warning_stream_pointer);
\end{verbatim}}
This function takes a character pointer and returns that same pointer after it has been filled.

{\setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
 \textbf{char *warning\_stream\_pointer} This input variable must point to allocated memory big enough to hold the the results of getWarningStreamSize plus a termination character.
}

\subsubsection{getPamgenInfoStreamSize}
{\ttfamily  \begin{verbatim}
int getPamgenInfoStreamSize(void);
\end{verbatim}}
This function returns the size of a string containing information messages generated within the Create\_Pamgen\_Mesh function. These messages include information such as the total number of elements in the mesh, the total number of nodes in the mesh, and the mesh distribution based on decomposition.

\subsubsection{getPamgenInfoStream}
{\ttfamily  \begin{verbatim}
char * getPamgenInfoStream(char * info_stream_pointer);
\end{verbatim}}
This function takes a character pointer and returns that same pointer after it has been filled.

\subsection{Querying a Mesh}
All of the mesh query and access functions are based on the \texttt{EXODUS II} ~\cite{Schoof-Yarberry:1995} and \texttt{NEMESIS} ~\cite{Hennigan-StJohn-Shadid:1998} APIs. These APIs were written to standardize a platform independent interface for writing and reading binary mesh specification files. \texttt{NEMESIS} is a parallel extension of the serial \texttt{EXODUS II} API.  The \textsc{pamgen} function names are formed by prefixing the \texttt{EXODUS II} or \texttt{NEMESIS} function name with \textbf{im\_}. The remainder of the function signature and functionality remains unchanged. It may help to note that the original \texttt{EXODUS II} functions begin with \textbf{ex\_}, and the original \texttt{NEMESIS} functions begin with \textbf{ne\_}. 

Querying a mesh database to build up a complete representation in accessible memory is a straightforward process.  Typically a query function is used to ascertain the number of items in an array, then memory is allocated and passed in through an access function which fills the memory with the requested information. The query and access functions will be presented in the same order they appear in the example function ``read\_mesh\_to\_memory()'' shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:read-mesh-to-memory}.


\subsubsection{im\_ex\_get\_init}
{\ttfamily  \begin{verbatim}
int im_ex_get_init( int exoid,
                    char *title,
                    int  *num_dim,
                    int  *num_nodes,
                    int  *num_elem, 
                    int  *num_elem_blk,
                    int  *num_node_sets,
                    int  *num_side_sets);
\end{verbatim}}
This function is based on the \texttt{EXODUS II} API and is concerned only with serial information. The number of nodes, elements, element blocks is limited to those entities local to the rank processor for which the mesh was created. It returns a non-zero value if an error occurs.

The first element's connectivity begins at an offset of 0 and the nth element's connectivity begins at an offset of n*num\_nodes\_per\_element. The \texttt{EXODUS II} standard specifies that the indices of the connectivity are numbered  from 1 so that in order to retrieve the coordinates of an element's nodes the indices given in \textbf{connect} must be decrimented by 1.}
