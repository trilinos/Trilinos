/*! \mainpage Stratimikos: Thyra-based strategies for linear solvers

The package Stratimikos contains a unified set of Thyra-based wrappers to
linear solver and preconditioner capabilities in Trilinos.  The word
"stratimikos" has no real meaning in itself; it was created from the Greek
words "stratigiki" and "grammikos" which mean "strategy" and "linear" in
English.  The Stratimikos package is also a place where unified testing of
linear solvers and preconditioners can be performed.  Given these object, you
can solve individual linear systems (see \ref stratimikos_examples_sec "examples").

Currently, Stratimikos is really just the single class
<tt>Stratimikos::LinearSolverBuilder</tt> which provides uniform access to
linear solver capabilities in Trilinos where the underlying operator can be
viewed as either an <tt>Epetra_CrsMatrix</tt> (or <tt>Epetra_RowMatrix</tt>)
object or a <tt>Tpetra::CrsMatrix</tt> (or <tt>Tpetra::RowMatrix></tt>)
object.  This class builds linear solvers using the Thyra linear solver and
preconditioner factory adapters listed below.  The linear solver and
preconditioner factories are returned as
<tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveFactoryBase</tt> and
<tt>Thyra::PreconditionerFactoryBase</tt> objects respectively.

The class <tt>Stratimikos::LinearSolverBuilder</tt> is parameter-list
driven.  All valid parameters are given below:

\endhtmlonly

An example parameter list in XML form that selects AztecOO and Ifpack
is shown below:

\verbinclude _aztecoo.ifpack.xml

<!-- The parameter <tt>"Linear Solver Type"</tt> selects the linear solver type
(currently supported are "Amesos", "AztecOO", and "Belos").  The parameter
<tt>"Preconditioner Type"</tt> selects the preconditioner type (currently
supported are "None", "ML", and "Ifpack"). -->

Many other example XML input files (e.g. <tt>*.xml</tt>) can be found in the
directory <tt>stratimikos/example</tt>.  <!--The full listing of supported
parameters can be found in the documentation for
<tt>Stratimikos::LinearSolverBuilder</tt>. -->

The example <tt>simple_stratimikos_example.cpp</tt> shows how to wrap Epetra
objects and then use <tt>Stratimikos::LinearSolverBuilder</tt> to solve
a linear system.

The example <tt>MixedOrderPhysicsBasedPreconditioner.cpp</tt> shows the use of
Stratimikos in a more sophisticated context.

See how all of the examples and tests are run by looking at
<tt>stratimikos/test/definition</tt>.

\section stratimikos_lows_adapters_sec Linear solver adapters

These adapters provide concrete subclasses implementing the abstract
interfaces <tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveFactoryBase</tt> and
<tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt>.  It is these implementations that are
used in the implementation of <tt>Stratimikos::LinearSolverBuilder</tt>
but they can also be used on their own.

<ul>

<li><tt>Thyra::AmesosLinearOpWithSolveFactory</tt> : Amesos/Thyra adapters.

<li><tt>Thyra::AztecOOLinearOpWithSolveFactory</tt> : AztecOO/Thyra adapters.

<li><tt>Thyra::BelosLinearOpWithSolveFactory</tt> : Belos/Thyra adapters.

These adapters provide concrete subclasses implementing the abstract interface
