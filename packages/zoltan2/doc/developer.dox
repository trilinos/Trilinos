\section z2_developer_organization Organization of an algorithm

Algorithms in Zoltan2 are namespace methods.  They are called by a
Zoltan2::Problem.  The Problem passes the following information to
the algorithm:

 -  A Zoltan2::Environment, described below.
 -  A Teuchos::Comm, a wrapper for the MPI communicator for the problem.
 -  A Zoltan2::Model, the computational model derived from the user's input data.
 -  A Zoltan2::Solution.

The Zoltan2::Environment contains the user's parameter settings, and
methods for handling exceptions, profiling and status messages.

Parallel communication is performed with the Teuchos::Comm object.
Probably the easiest way to do this is by using the helper functions in 
\ref z2_developer_teuchos_comm.

The Environment also has a communicator, which is the communicator for
the entire application.  The communicator passed in as the 2nd
argument of the algorithm is the communicator for the problem, which
may be different if the problem is being solved over
a subset of the entire application.

The Zoltan2::Model is created by the Problem based on the type of
input provided by the user and information in the user's parameters.
The Model may represent one of the following objects:

 -   A Zoltan2::IdentifierModel is simply a collection of global identifiers.
 -   A Zoltan2::CoordinateModel is a collection of geometric coordinates of arbitrary dimension.
 -   A Zoltan2::GraphModel is an undirected graph.

A hypergraph model will be added eventually.

The Zoltan2::Solution is created by the Problem.  When passed to the
algorithm, it may already contain some information about the type
of solution desired.  In particular, in the case of
partitioning, the subclass Zoltan2::PartitioningSolution contains the
global number of parts to be created, the number of parts to be created
for each process, and the relative part sizes.  

The algorithm writes the computed answer back
to the Solution object.  In particular, a partitioning
algorithm writes back the assignment of 
part numbers to global identifiers.  The user can obtain the solution
by way of the method Zoltan2::PartitioningProblem::getSolution().

\code 
template <typename Adapter>
void myAlgorithm(
  const RCP<const Environment> &env,
  const RCP<Comm<int> > &problemComm,
  const RCP<const GraphModel<typename Adapter::base_adapter_t> > &graph,
  RCP<PartitioningSolution<Adapter> > &solution
)
{
  typedef typename Adapter::lno_t lno_t;     // local ids
  typedef typename Adapter::gno_t gno_t;     // global ids
  typedef typename Adapter::scalar_t scalar_t;   // scalars

  gno_t *globalNumbers=NULL;
  partId_t *partNumbers=NULL;

  size_t numGnos = callSolve(env, problemComm, graph,
    globalNumbers, partNumbers);

  ArrayRCP<const gno_t> gnos = arcp(globalNumbers, 0, numGnos, true);
  ArrayRCP<const partId_t> gnoPart = arcp(partNumbers, 0, numGnos, true);

  solution->setParts(gnos, gnoPart);
}
\endcode

\section z2_developer_environment The Environment

The Zoltan2::Environment object is created by the Zoltan2::Problem.  It is
passed to almost every method in the library.  It serves the following roles:

  - It has the Teuchos::ParameterList that was set by the user, which has been processed by running the parameter list validators.
  - It enables the library behavior that was requested by the user via parameters such as:
   - \ref debug_level
   - \ref debug_output_stream
   - \ref error_check_level
   - \ref memory_output_stream
   - \ref timer_type

The algorithm uses the Environment to obtain algorithm-specific
parameters that may have been set by the user.  It also uses Environment
methods to print out warnings and status information, handle exceptions, 
time algorithm steps, and display information about the amount of memory
in use.

\section z2_developer_ids Global identifiers and data types

Zoltan2 is a package in the <a href=http://trilinos.org/ >
Trilinos</a> framework and it uses the linear algebra classes in
the templated Tpetra package.  The
data types permitted for global identifiers in Tpetra are those for which
specializations of the Teuchos::OrdinalTraits exist.  In particular
we use \c int or \c long internally for the global identifiers of linear
algebra objects.

For historical reasons, Zoltan2 allows the user a broader range of data types
for their identifiers.  In particular, any data type for which a
specialization of Zoltan2::IdentifierTraits is defined is allowed.
For example, a global identifier could be a std::pair<int, int>
to represent matrix non-zeros <em> (i, j) </em>.  Or the global
identifier could be an arbitrary string.

If the user's global identifiers are not Teuchos Ordinals, 
the Zoltan2::Model maps them to new global identifiers which
\e are Teuchos Ordinals. 

By convention we use these typedef names:

\li \b gid_t (global id) the data type of the user's global identifiers
\li \b gno_t (global number) our internal global identifier

It is obviously more efficient if Zoltan2 can use the user's global identifiers without
having to map them.  We have to map them only if:

 - the \c gid_t is not a Teuchos Ordinal or,
 - the algorithm requires consecutive global ids and the user did not provide consecutive ids

The Zoltan2::Solution object uses mapping information in the Zoltan2::Model
to map the internal \c gno_t ids back to the user's \c gid_t ids if
necessary.  In this way, the algorithm can work with \c gno_t ids and
supply these to the Solution, but the user can retrieve \c gid_t ids.

The complexity of mapping between user global identifiers and internal global
identifiers is encapsulated in the Zoltan2::Model.

\section z2_developer_naming Naming

All Zoltan2 symbols are in the namespace \b Zoltan2.

We follow the Trilinos naming conventions.  They are detailed in a document
in directory Trilinos/doc/TrilinosCodingDocGuidelines.

Templated code is in \b .hpp files and non-templated code is in \b .cpp files.

<hr>
\section z2_developer_exceptions Error handling

We check for three types of errors:

  \li \b bug which is an event that would not occur if the code had been written correctly (throws a std::logic_error)
  \li \b input which is an error is due to bad user data or parameter values (throws a std::runtime_error)
  \li \b memory which is when we are unable to allocate the needed memory (throws a std::bad_alloc)

In addition, a check can be local or global.  In a global check, all processes report an error if any process has an error.  Local checks are non-synchronizing.

Each check also has a level of complexity.  Some can be done with one or two
comparisons and some require more work. Also, there are some checks we
only want to do in a special \e debug mode.

The user specifies the level of error checking to do with the \c error_check_level parameter.  It can be set to one of these strings:

  - \c no_assertions
  - \c basic_assertions
  - \c complex_assertions
  - \c debug_mode_assertions

The default is \c basic_assertions.  If the user requests \c complex_assertions, the lengthier checks will be done as well.  If the users requests
\c debug_mode_assertions , all checking will be done.

If the user sets \c error_check_level to \c no_assertions then none of the checks will be done.  In addition, if Zoltan2 is compiled with the Z2_OMIT_ALL_ERROR_CHECKING flag, the error check methods do nothing.  So in this case there is not even a comparison of the check level to the requested check level.

The methods that perform the tests are in the Zoltan2::Environment.  They are:

 - Zoltan2::Environment::localInputAssertion()
 - Zoltan2::Environment::globalInputAssertion()
 - Zoltan2::Environment::localBugAssertion()
 - Zoltan2::Environment::globalBugAssertion()
 - Zoltan2::Environment::localMemoryAssertion()
 - Zoltan2::Environment::globalMemoryAssertion()

The Zoltan2::AssertionLevel enumerator defines the levels that are provided in the calls.

\section z2_developer_status_info Status and debugging output

The following parameters govern behavior of messages from Zoltan2:

 - \ref debug_level which is the amount of verbosity
 - \ref debug_procs which specifies the processes that will print output
 - \ref debug_output_file which is the name of a file to receive the output (the rank of the process doing the output is appended to the file name)
 - \ref debug_output_stream which can be \c cout or \c cerr

The Zoltan2::Environment::debug() message is used for printing out debug and status information and warnings.  The call should specify the Zoltan2::MessageOutputLevel (the verbosity of the message). 

The Zoltan2::Environment::getDebugLevel() call should  be checked before creating a lengthy message.  This will ensure that work is not done for a detailed message if the users \c debug_level parameter did not request it.

<hr>
\section z2_developer_profiling Profiling

The Zoltan2::Environment object which is passed to almost every function
has methods that can be used to time sections of code and (on Linux
systems) to print out the memory in use by the process.  The behavior of
these methods depends on the how the user set these parameters:

 - \ref memory_output_file
 - \ref memory_output_stream
 - \ref memory_procs
 - \ref timer_output_file
 - \ref timer_output_stream
 - \ref timer_type

The memory count is read from <tt> /proc/{pid}/statm </tt> and output to the designated file or stream while the application is running.  The timers are managed
by a Teuchos::TimeMonitor object in the Problem.  The timer summary is output to the designated file or stream and timers are reset to zero when the application calls Zoltan2::Problem::printTimers().

For timers, the concept of \ref timer_type refers to the concept of <tt> macro_timers </tt> and <tt> micro_timers </tt>.  In general, the micro timers time subsets of actions that are timed by the macro timers.  At run-time you can choose which timers to activate.  For developers, there are also <tt> test_timers </tt>  These are timers you may add while doing development or doing performance studies.  The expectation is that you will remove them when done.

\section z2_developer_rcp Use of Teuchos smart pointers

Smart pointers remove the need for the programmer to keep track of
when memory must be freed.  Teucho smart pointers in addition can
do array bounds checking when compiled with the cmake configuration flag
\b Teuchos_ENABLE_ABC (automatic bounds check).

We use the following Teuchos memory management classes in Zoltan2:

\li Teuchos::RCP and Teuchos::ArrayRCP for pointers to a single object or an array that persists outside of a function.  We use these for class data.  They have reference counters that keep track of how many pointers to the memory exist.  When the reference counter returns to 0, the memory is automatically freed.

\li Teuchos::Ptr and Teuchos::Array wrap pointers to a single object or to an array, but without reference counting.  The reason to use them is to be able to do bounds checking.  They are used for data that does not persist outside fo the scope in which it is created.  An \b Array is dynamic in size and implements much of the \b std::vector interface.

Teuchos::RCP and Teuchos::ArrayRCP can also be used for non-persisting data if you want an easy way to ensure that the memory will be freed upon leaving the scope in which the memory was allocated.

In addition, Teuchos::Tuple can be used for small fixed size arrays.
Teuchos::ArrayView is used for function arguments that were passed as
Teuchos::ArrayRCP (and will not be \e saved by the function) or Teuchos::Array.
(If the function is a class method that will hold on to the array in the
class instance, then the function argument should be a reference to a
Teuchos::ArrayRCP so it will be counted.)

Using Teuchos memory management classes can increase the time to write code, and make code a little harder to read, but once the code compiles it is very unlikely that a memory error will be found later on.

A detailed report on Teuchos memory management classes can be found in the directory Trilinos/doc/TeuchosMemoryManagementSAND.

\section z2_developer_parameters How to add a parameter

Zoltan2 uses Teuchos::ParameterList and Teuchos::ParameterEntryValidator. To
add another parameter you add it to %XML definition of the ParameterList in
zoltan2/data/parameters.xml.  

At compile time, the program
zoltan2/util/xmlToHeaderDefinition.cpp creates the header file 
zoltan2_binary_directory/src/Zoltan2_XML_Parameters.hpp.  This header file
contains a macro that has the %XML string defining the parameters.  It is
used at run-time in the namespace method Zoltan2::createAllParameters().

When building the Zoltan2 documentation with zoltan2/doc/build_docs, the
script zoltan2/scripts/xml2dox.py creates the Doxygen page in
zoltan2/doc/parameters.dox.

The %XML formats for the validator are documented here:

 - Teuchos::StringToIntegralValidatorXMLConverter
 - Teuchos::AnyNumberValidatorXMLConverter
 - Teuchos::EnhancedNumberValidatorXMLConverter
 - Teuchos::FileNameValidatorXMLConverter
 - Teuchos::StringValidatorXMLConverter
 - Zoltan2::IntegerRangeListValidatorXMLConverter

The %XML format for the parameter is:

\code

<Parameter
  id="unique number for this parameter" 
  name="name of this parameter" 
  type="data type of value used to set parameter" 
  validatorId="id number for validator for this parameter" 
  value="any valid value for this parameter"
  docString="description of parameter that will appear in documentation"
  />

\endcode

The \c docString in the \c Parameter element
does not need to include information (like a list of valid strings)
that is included in the \c Validator element.  When parameter documentation
is generated, either by Teuchos at run-time or by a script in \c doc/build_docs,
it includes the validator information.
