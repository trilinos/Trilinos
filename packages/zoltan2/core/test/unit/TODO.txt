It's possible that at this point unit tests could be simplified.

It would be good to test with varying template parameters, maybe by using the Teuchos unit test framework.

We have no unit test for:

util/StridedInput
util/Util

problems/PartitioningProblem
problems/PartitioningSolution

input/InputTraits

environment/DebugManager
environment/MetricOutputManager
environment/Environment
environment/Exceptions

algorithms/ScotchPartitioning
algorithms/BlockPartitioning

We have no unit test for the ordering algorithms, problem and solution,
but these are in flux at the moment.

We are not testing performance yet.  

We are not testing for memory leaks or for amount of memory used.
