/*! \file Zoltan2_Solution.hpp
    \brief Defines the Solution base class.
    \todo The Solution classes are part of the API.  This is problematic
                right now - they use many internal classes and are used
                by Problems and algorithms.  Maybe there
                should be a SolutionAPI object within the Solution which
                is the visible part of the Solution.
           The source for this class could be
                 in the src/input directory.  This is where the input
                 adapters which use that part of the solution reside.
