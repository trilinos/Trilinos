Trilinos v11 is the initial release of Zoltan2.  Zoltan2 is a redesign of the
Zoltan combinatorial scientific computing toolkit that uses templating and
Trilinos classes for tighter integration with Trilinos.  Zoltan2 includes
several data ordering and partitioning algorithms.

Capabilities that are supported by default in Zoltan2:
   Minimum-degree data ordering using the AMD TPL
   Reverse Cuthill-McGee data ordering
   Graph partitioning using the Scotch TPL
   Block partitioning

Experimental capabilities are supported only if the following CMake option 
is used; these capabilities are under development.
  -D Zoltan2_ENABLE_Experimental:BOOL=ON

Experimental capabilities include:
   Recursive Coordinate Bisection geometric partitioning
   PQJagged geometric partitioning
   Spectral data ordering
   Increasing degree data ordering
   Natural data ordering
   Random data ordering
