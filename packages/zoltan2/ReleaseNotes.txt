Release notes for Trilinos v11.14 

The PartitioningSolution class's interface has changed.
-  methods getPartList and getProcList have been renamed to 
   getPartListView and getProcListView to emphasize that a view, not a copy,
   is being returned.
-  method getPartListView now returns the part identifiers in the same order
   that the local data was provided.  The user's localData[i] is assigned 
   to getPartListView()[i].  Conversions from global identifiers
   from PartitioningSolution::getIdList() to local identifiers are no longer
   needed.  
-  methods getIdList and getLocalNumberOfIds have been removed.
-  method convertSolutionToImportList has been removed and replaced 
   by the helper function getImportList in Zoltan2_PartitioningHelpers.hpp.
-  pointAssign and boxAssign methods have been added for some geometric 
   partitioners.  Support is provided through MultiJagged (MJ) partitioning.
   pointAssign returns a part number that contains a given geometric point.  
   boxAssign returns all parts that overlap a given geometric box.

New graph coloring options:
- The parameter color_choice can be used to obtain a more balanced coloring.
  Valid values are FirstFit, Random, RandomFast, and LeastUsed.

New partitioning options:
-  Scotch interface updated to Scotch v6 or later (Tested against v6.0.3.)
-  Interface to ParMETIS v4 or later added.  (Tested against v4.0.3.)

Release notes for Trilinos v11.8

Simplified input Adapter classes for easier implementation by applications.
(This change may break backward compatibility for some users.)

Added ability to associate coordinates with matrix rows and graph vertices
through the MatrixAdapter and GraphAdapter.

Improved the performance and readability of Multijagged Partitioning.
Some parameter names have changed or have been deleted:
        pqParts --> mj_parts
        parallel_part_calculation_count --> mj_concurrent_part_count
        migration_check_option --> mj_migration_option
        migration_imbalance_cut_off --> mj_minimum_migration_imbalance
        keep_part_boxes --> mj_keep_part_boxes
        recursion_depth --> mj_recursion_depth
        migration_processor_assignment_type deleted.
        migration_all_to_all_type deleted.
        migration_doMigration_type deleted.


Added weights to graph partitioning via Scotch.

Changed weight specifications in input Adapters; users can no longer provide
NULL weight arrays for uniform weights.

Added more robuts testing.

Fixed several bugs.

----------------------------------


Trilinos v11 is the initial release of Zoltan2.  Zoltan2 is a redesign of the
Zoltan combinatorial scientific computing toolkit that uses templating and
Trilinos classes for tighter integration with Trilinos.  Zoltan2 supports
Epetra and Tpetra data structures through the Xpetra interface.

Capabilities that are supported by default in Zoltan2:
   Minimum-degree data ordering using the AMD TPL
   Reverse Cuthill-McKee data ordering
   Graph partitioning using the Scotch TPL
   Block partitioning

Experimental capabilities are supported only if the following CMake option 
is used; these capabilities are under development.
  -D Zoltan2_ENABLE_Experimental:BOOL=ON

Experimental capabilities include:
   Recursive Coordinate Bisection geometric partitioning
   Multidimensional-Jagged geometric partitioning
   Spectral data ordering
   Increasing degree data ordering
   Natural data ordering
   Random data ordering
