/* Perform a depth-first-search starting at column k, to find an augmenting
 * path.  An augmenting path is a sequence of row/column pairs (i1,k), (i2,j1),
 * (i3,j2), ..., (i(s+1), js), such that all of the following properties hold:
 *
 *	* column k is not matched to any row
 *	* entries in the path are nonzero
 *	* the pairs (i1,j1), (i2,j2), (i3,j3) ..., (is,js) have been 
 *	    previously matched to each other
 *	* (i(s+1), js) is nonzero, and row i(s+1) is not matched to any column
 *
 * Once this path is found, the matching can be changed to the set of pairs
 * path.  An augmenting path is a sequence of row/column pairs
 *
 *	(i1,k), (i2,j1), (i3,j2), ..., (i(s+1), js)
 *
 * Once a row is matched with a column it remains matched with some column, but
 * not necessarily the column it was first matched with.
 *
 * This routine is very similar to the dfs routine in klu_kernel.c, in the
 * KLU sparse LU factorization package.
 *
 * The algorithm is based on the paper "On Algorithms for obtaining a maximum
 * transversal" by Iain Duff, ACM Trans. Mathematical Software, vol 7, no. 1,
 * pp. 315-330, and "Algorithm 575: Permutations for a zero-free diagonal",
 * same issue, pp. 387-390.  The code here is a new implementation of that
 * algorithm, with different data structures and control flow.  After writing
 * this code, I carefully compared my algorithm with MC21A/B (ACM Algorithm 575)
 * Some of the comparisons are partial because I didn't dig deeply into all of
 * the details of MC21A/B, such as how the stack is maintained.  The following
 * arguments are essentially identical between this code and MC21A:
 *
 * maxtrans	MC21A,B
 * --------	-------
 * n		N	    identical
 * k		JORD	    identical
 * Ap		IP	    column / row pointers
 * Ai		ICN	    row / column indices
 * Ap[n]	LICN	    length of index array (# of nonzeros in A)
 * Match	IPERM	    output column / row permutation
 * nfound	NUMNZ	    # of nonzeros on diagonal of permuted matrix
 * Flag		CV	    mark a node as visited by the depth-first-search
 *
 * The following are different, but analogous:
 *
 * Cheap	ARP	    indicates what part of the a column / row has
 *			    already been matched.
 *
 * The following arguments are very different:
 *
 * -		LENR	    # of entries in each row/column (unused in maxtrans)
 * Pstack	OUT	    Pstack keeps track of where we are in the depth-
 *			    first-search scan of column j.  I think that OUT
 *			    plays a similar role in MC21B, but I'm unsure.
 * Istack	PR	    keeps track of the rows in the path.  PR is a link
 *			    list, though, whereas Istack is a stack.  Maxtrans
 *			    does not use any link lists.
 * Jstack	OUT? PR?    the stack for nodes in the path (unsure)
 *
 * The following control structures are roughly comparable:
 *
 * maxtrans			MC21B
 * --------			-----
 * for (k = 0 ; k < n ; k++)	DO 100 JORD=1,N
 * while (head >= 0)		DO 70 K=1,JORD
 * for (p = Cheap [j] ; ...)	DO 20 II=IN1,IN2
 * for (p = head ; ...)		DO 90 K=1,JORD
