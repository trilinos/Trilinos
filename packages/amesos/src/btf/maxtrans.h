/* MAXTRANS: finds a permutation of the columns of a matrix so that it has a
 * zero-free diagonal.  The input is an n-by-n sparse matrix in compressed
 * column form.  The array Ap of size n+1 gives the starting and ending
 * positions of the columns in the array Ai.  Ap[0] must be zero. The array Ai
 * contains the row indices of the nonzeros of the matrix A, and is of size
 * Ap[n].  The row indices of column j are located in Ai[Ap[j] ... Ap[j+1]-1].
 * Row indices must be in the range 0 to n-1.  Duplicate entries may be present
 * in any given column.  The input matrix  is not checked for validity (row
 * indices out of the range 0 to n-1 will lead to an undeterminate result -
 * possibly a core dump, for example).  Row indices in any given column need
 * not be in sorted order.  However, if they are sorted and the matrix already
 * has a zero-free diagonal, then the identity permutation is returned.
 *
 * The output of maxtrans is an array Match of size n.  If row i is matched with
 * column j, then A(i,j) is nonzero, and then Match[i] = j.  If the matrix is
 * structurally nonzero, all entries in the Match array are unique.  The Match
 * array can also be interpreted as a column permutation.  That is, column k of
 * the original matrix becomes column Match[k] of the permuted matrix.  In
 * MATLAB, this can be expressed as (for non-structurally singular matrices):
 *
 *	Match = maxtrans (A) ;
 *	B = A (:, Match) ;
 *
 * except of course here the A matrix and Match vector are all 0-based (rows
 * and columns in the range 0 to n-1), not 1-based (rows/cols in range 1 to n).
 * The MATLAB dmperm routine returns a row permutation.  See the maxtrans
 * mexFunction for more details.
 *
 * If row i is not matched to any column, then Match[i] is < -1.  To find a
 * complete permutation can be returned, let j = (-(Match[i])-2) if
 * Match[i] < -1. The column index j can be computed using the macro
 *
 *	j = MAXTRANS_UNFLIP (Match [i]) ;
 *
 * Then row i can be considered to be matched to column j, except that the
 * A(i,j) entry is zero if Match[i] < 0.  If any such row i exists, the matrix
 * is structurally singular.  The maxtrans routine returns the number of
 * nonzeros on the permuted matrix.
 *
 * In the MATLAB mexFunction interface to maxtrans, 1 is added to the Match
 * array to obtain a 1-based permutation.  Thus, in MATLAB:
 *
 *	Match = maxtrans (A) ;	% has entries in the range 1:n and -(1:n)
 *	p = abs (Match) ;	% the permutation (either full rank or singular)
 *	B = A (:, p) ;		% permuted matrix (either full rank or singular)
 *	find (Match < 0) ;	% gives a list of zero diagonal entries of B
 *	sum (Match > 0) ;	% same as "sprank (A)"
 *
 * This behaviour differs from p = dmperm (A) in MATLAB, which returns p(i)=0
 * if row i is unmatched.  Thus:
 *
 *	p = dmperm (A) ;	% has entries in the range 0:n
 *	p                       % the permutation (only if full rank)
 *	B = A (:, p) ;		% permuted matrix (only if full rank)
 *	find (p == 0) ;		% gives a list of zero diagonal entries of B
 *	sum (p > 0) ;		% definition of sprank (A)
 *
 * This algorithm is based on the paper "On Algorithms for obtaining a maximum
 * transversal" by Iain Duff, ACM Trans. Mathematical Software, vol 7, no. 1,
 * pp. 315-330, and "Algorithm 575: Permutations for a zero-free diagonal",
 * same issue, pp. 387-390.  Algorithm 575 is MC21A in the Harwell Subroutine
 * Library.  This code is not merely a translation of the Fortran code into C.
 * It is a completely new implementation of the basic underlying method (depth
 * first search over a subgraph with nodes corresponding to columns matched so
 * far, and cheap matching).  This code was written with minimal observation of
 * the MC21A/B code itself.  See comments below for a comparison between the
 * maxtrans and MC21A/B codes.
 *
 * This routine operates on a column-form matrix and produces a column
 * permutation.  MC21A uses a row-form matrix and produces a row permutation.
 * The difference is merely one of convention in the comments and interpretation
 * of the inputs and outputs.  If you want a row permutation, simply pass a
 * compressed-row sparse matrix to this routine and you will get a row
 * permutation (just like MC21A).  Similarly, you can pass a column-oriented
 * matrix to MC21A and it will happily return a column permutation.
