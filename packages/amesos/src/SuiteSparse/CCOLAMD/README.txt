-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CCOLAMD column approximate minimum degree ordering algorithm computes
a permutation vector P such that the LU factorization of A (:,P)
tends to be sparser than that of A.  The Cholesky factorization of
(A (:,P))'*(A (:,P)) will also tend to be sparser than that of A'*A.
CSYMAMD is a symmetric minimum degree ordering method based on CCOLAMD, also
available as a MATLAB-callable function.  It constructs a matrix M such
that M'*M has the same pattern as A, and then uses CCOLAMD to compute a column
ordering of M.

Requires UFconfig, in the ../UFconfig directory relative to this directory.

To compile and install the ccolamd m-files and mexFunctions, just cd to
CCOLAMD/MATLAB and type ccolamd_install in the MATLAB command window.
A short demo will run.  Optionally, type ccolamd_test to run an extensive tests.
Type "make" in Unix in the CCOLAMD directory to compile the C-callable
library and to run a short demo.

If you have MATLAB 7.2 or earlier, you must first edit UFconfig/UFconfig.h to
remove the "-largeArrayDims" option from the MEX command (or just use
ccolamd_install.m inside MATLAB).

Other "make" targets:

    make mex		compiles MATLAB mexFunctions only
    make libccolamd.a	compiles a C-callable library containing ccolamd
    make clean		removes all files not in the distribution, except for
			libccolamd.a
    make distclean	removes all files not in the distribution

To use ccolamd and csymamd within an application written in C, all you need are
ccolamd.c and ccolamd.h, which are the C-callable ccolamd/csymamd codes.
See ccolamd.c for more information on how to call ccolamd from a C program.
It contains a complete description of the C-interface to CCOLAMD and CSYMAMD.
