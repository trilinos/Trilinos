/* === BTF_MAXTRANS ========================================================= */
/* ========================================================================== */

/* Finds a column permutation that maximizes the number of entries on the
 * diagonal of a sparse matrix.  See btf.h for more information.
 *
 * This function is identical to cs_maxtrans in CSparse, with the following
 * exceptions:
 *
 *  (1) cs_maxtrans finds both jmatch and imatch, where jmatch [i] = j and
 *	imatch [j] = i if row i is matched to column j.  This function returns
 *	just jmatch (the Match array).  The MATLAB interface to cs_maxtrans
 *	(the single-output cs_dmperm) returns imatch, not jmatch to the MATLAB
 *	caller.
 *
 *  (2) cs_maxtrans includes a pre-pass that counts the number of non-empty
 *	rows and columns (m2 and n2, respectively), and computes the matching
 *	using the transpose of A if m2 < n2.  cs_maxtrans also returns quickly
 *	if the diagonal of the matrix is already zero-free.  This pre-pass
 *	allows cs_maxtrans to be much faster than maxtrans, if the use of the
 *	transpose is warranted.
 *
 *	However, for square structurally non-singular matrices with one or more
 *	zeros on the diagonal, the pre-pass is a waste of time, and for these
 *	matrices, maxtrans can be twice as fast as cs_maxtrans.  Since the
 *	maxtrans function is intended primarily for square matrices that are
 *	typically structurally nonsingular, the pre-pass is not included here.
 *	If this maxtrans function is used on a matrix with many more columns
 *	than rows, consider passing the transpose to this function, or use
 *	cs_maxtrans instead.
 *
 *  (3) cs_maxtrans can operate as a randomized algorithm, to help avoid
 *	rare cases of excessive run-time.
 *
 *  (4) this maxtrans function includes an option that limits the total work
 *	performed.  If this limit is reached, the maximum transveral might not
 *	be found.
 *
 * Thus, for general usage, cs_maxtrans is preferred.  For square matrices that
 * are typically structurally non-singular, maxtrans is preferred.  A partial
 * maxtrans can still be very useful when solving a sparse linear system.

/* Perform a depth-first-search starting at column k, to find an augmenting
 * path.  An augmenting path is a sequence of row/column pairs (i1,k), (i2,j1),
 * (i3,j2), ..., (i(s+1), js), such that all of the following properties hold:
 *
 *	* column k is not matched to any row
 *	* entries in the path are nonzero
 *	* the pairs (i1,j1), (i2,j2), (i3,j3) ..., (is,js) have been 
 *	    previously matched to each other
 *	* (i(s+1), js) is nonzero, and row i(s+1) is not matched to any column
 *
 * Once this path is found, the matching can be changed to the set of pairs
 * path.  An augmenting path is a sequence of row/column pairs
 *
 *	(i1,k), (i2,j1), (i3,j2), ..., (i(s+1), js)
 *
 * Once a row is matched with a column it remains matched with some column, but
 * not necessarily the column it was first matched with.
 *
 * In the worst case, this function can examine every nonzero in A.  Since it
 * is called n times by maxtrans, the total time of maxtrans can be as high as
 * O(n*nnz(A)).  To limit this work, pass a value of maxwork > 0.  Then at
 * most O((maxwork+1)*nnz(A)) work will be performed; the maximum matching might
 * not be found, however.
 *
 * This routine is very similar to the dfs routine in klu_kernel.c, in the
 * KLU sparse LU factorization package.  It is essentially identical to the
 * cs_augment routine in CSparse, and its recursive version (augment function
 * in cs_maxtransr_mex.c), except that this routine allows for the search to be
 * terminated early if too much work is being performed.
 *
 * The algorithm is based on the paper "On Algorithms for obtaining a maximum
 * transversal" by Iain Duff, ACM Trans. Mathematical Software, vol 7, no. 1,
 * pp. 315-330, and "Algorithm 575: Permutations for a zero-free diagonal",
 * same issue, pp. 387-390.  The code here is a new implementation of that
 * algorithm, with different data structures and control flow.  After writing
 * this code, I carefully compared my algorithm with MC21A/B (ACM Algorithm 575)
 * Some of the comparisons are partial because I didn't dig deeply into all of
 * the details of MC21A/B, such as how the stack is maintained.  The following
 * arguments are essentially identical between this code and MC21A:
 *
 * maxtrans	MC21A,B
 * --------	-------
 * n		N	    identical
 * k		JORD	    identical
 * Ap		IP	    column / row pointers
 * Ai		ICN	    row / column indices
 * Ap[n]	LICN	    length of index array (# of nonzeros in A)
 * Match	IPERM	    output column / row permutation
 * nmatch	NUMNZ	    # of nonzeros on diagonal of permuted matrix
 * Flag		CV	    mark a node as visited by the depth-first-search
 *
 * The following are different, but analogous:
 *
 * Cheap	ARP	    indicates what part of the a column / row has
 *			    already been matched.
 *
 * The following arguments are very different:
 *
 * -		LENR	    # of entries in each row/column (unused in maxtrans)
 * Pstack	OUT	    Pstack keeps track of where we are in the depth-
 *			    first-search scan of column j.  I think that OUT
 *			    plays a similar role in MC21B, but I'm unsure.
 * Istack	PR	    keeps track of the rows in the path.  PR is a link
 *			    list, though, whereas Istack is a stack.  Maxtrans
 *			    does not use any link lists.
 * Jstack	OUT? PR?    the stack for nodes in the path (unsure)
 *
 * The following control structures are roughly comparable:
 *
 * maxtrans			MC21B
 * --------			-----
 * for (k = 0 ; k < n ; k++)	DO 100 JORD=1,N
 * while (head >= 0)		DO 70 K=1,JORD
 * for (p = Cheap [j] ; ...)	DO 20 II=IN1,IN2
 * for (p = head ; ...)		DO 90 K=1,JORD
