\section Developers

Amesos is a Trilinos package, developed by K. Stanley, M. Sala,
R. Hoekstra, T. Davis, and M. Heroux.

\section intro Introduction 
Amesos provides an object-oriented interface
to several direct sparse solvers, both sequential and parallel.

<p>At this stage of development, Amesos supported the following classes:

<ul> 

<li> Amesos_Klu - Interface to Tim Davis serial solver KLU (distributed within Amesos). 
<li> Amesos_Superlu - Interface to Xiaoye Li's SuperLU serial memory code with serial input interface.
<li> Amesos_Superludist - Interface to Xiaoye Li's SuperLU Distributed memory code with serial input interface (version 2.0 or later).
<li> Amesos_Dscpack - Interface to Padma Raghavan's DSCPACK
<li> Amesos_Umfpack - Interface to Tim Davis's UMFPACK (version 4.3 or later)
<li> Amesos_Mumps - Interface to CERFACS' MUMPS (version 4.3.1 or later)
</ul>

We refer to the Sandia report SAND-2004-2188 for a detailed overview of
Amesos. A PDF version of this report can be found the
<tt>Trilinos/packages/amesos/doc/AmesosReferenceGuide/AmesosReferenceGuide.pdf</tt>.

<P>Note: Support is under development for an interface to ScaLAPACK.

</ul>

\section Copyright  Copyright and licensing of the third party codes

<p>Each of the Amesos base classes is based on a third party code.  Each
third party code comes with its own copyright and/or licensing
requirements.  It is your responsibility to check with the author's of
those codes (in many case you will need to do so to obtain
a copy of the code) to make sure that you understand the terms of the
copyright and/or licensing.  

<p>Most of these third party codes are intended to be made available at
no cost to users.  Much of the copyright and licensing restrictions
concern rights to modify, redistribute the code and generally include a 
request that credit be given in any papers which make use of their code.
Please refer to the web page for the package that you are interested in 
for details.  

<p>It is the intent of the SuperLU team to make SuperLU and SuperLUdist
freely available without any copyright restrictions, i.e. not even GPL
restrictions.

\section install  Installing Amesos 

Each of the Amesos classes provides an interface to a third
party direct sparse solver code.  In order to install a particular
class, you must first install the underlying direct sparse solver
code.  Amesos installation requires four steps:
<ul>
<li>Finding MPI for your machine.
<li>Finding optimized BLAS for your machine.
<li>Installing the third party code needed by the Amesos class that you intend to use
<li>Configuring Trilinos with Amesos.
</ul>

Additional architecture specific hints can be found in the CVS repositiory ~/Trilinos3PL/config.   A copy, albeit a potentially out-of-date copy, of ~/Trilinos3PL/config can be found at:  <a href="http://www.cs.utk.edu/~kstanley/Trilinos3PL/config">http://www.cs.utk.edu/~kstanley/Trilinos3PL/config</a>.  

\subsection mpi Finding MPI for your architecture
<ul><li>
Most parallel sparse direct solvers are built on MPI.  
If Trilinos/config has a configure invocation script for your
architecture, you can look for --with-mpi there.  
Mpich, a portable implementation of MPI, is available from 
the <a href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich">MPICH website</a>. 
LAM/MPI  is available from the <a href="http://www.lam-mpi.org/"> LAM/MPI website</a>.  On many systems using the right mpicc and mpif77 for compilation and linking avoids the need to specify the mpi libraries and include path.  LAM/MPI uses hcc and hf77.  

<li><b>For existing Trilinos users:</b> Trilinos uses configure to help
find mpi and the blas.  If you have already configured Trilinos with
mpi, configure presumably found mpi and the blas.  To find a link
command which configure used, cd to packages/epetra in your build
directory and type: "grep conftest config.log | tail" and examine the
last line.
</ul>


\subsection blas Finding Optimized BLAS for your architecture

<ul> <li>Most sparse direct
solvers require BLAS, or at least take advantage of them.  
If Trilinos/config has a configure invocation script for your
architecture, you can look for --with-blas there.
If your architecture does not offer optimized BLAS,
<a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net">ATLAS</a> will create an 
optimized BLAS library for you.  

<li><b>For existing Trilinos users:</b>See the section by this same name
under "Finding MPI for your arhitecture."

Refer to the Readme for more complete testing and for an explanation
of the above execution of Solve1.  There is nothing particular about
those parameters, many other combinations work.  

</ul>

<li>MUMPS
<ul>

<li>MUMPS is Fortran 90 code, and hence requires n F90 compiler.  All
ASCI computers are required to support F90.

<li>MUMPS uses ScaLAPACK (which in turn requires the BLACS) to solve
large root node problems.  Hence, you will need to obtain a copy of <a
href="http://www.netlib.org/scalapack">ScaLAPACK</a> and the <a
href="http://www.netlib.org/blacs">BLACS</a>.  There are pre-built libraries 
for most architectures.  (Note: MUMPS can be built
without ScaLAPACK and the BLACS.)  Use LIBS=" " 
to link in the ScaLAPACK and BLACS libraries.

<li>Obtain the DSCPACK distribution from <a
href="http://www.enseeiht.fr/lima/apo/MUMPS">The MUMPS 
web site</a>.  You will have to submit a form.
The MUMPS team typically answers within a day - if they do not, let me
know (kstanley@cs.utk.edu). Note:  Amesos_Mumps is based on MUMPS_4.2_beta.  
We will upgrade to Mumps 4.3, July 2003, in the near future.  
 
<li>Untar the MUMPS code in your Trilinos3PL directory.

<li>Modify Makefile.inc.  See ~/Trilinos3PL/config/MUMPS_4.2_beta/
and/or the Make.inc diretory in the MUMPS distribution.

<li>Build MUMPS.  Type "make" in the top level directory: MUMPS_4.2_beta.  

<li>Sanity checks.
<ul>
<li>mpirun -np 2 c_example
<p>Should produce "Solution is : (    1.00     2.00 ) 
<p>
<li>mpirun -np 2 dsimpletest < input_simpletest_real 
<p>Should produce roughly 73 lines of output of which the last is:
<p>  Solution is 1., 2., 3., 4., 5. (or something close to that)
</ul>
</ul>
</ul>


\subsection Common link errors

<ul>
<li>e_wsfe, do_fio and other undefined externals are fortran I/O routines required by some BLAS libraries.  Use a fortran linker or see the instructions above for determining find how configure links.
<li>dgemm, dgemv, daxpy and other undefined externals are in the BLAS library.  See above for instructions on how to find a blas library.  
<li>MPI_Init, MPI_Barrier and other undefined externals are from the MPI library.  See instructions above for finding the MPI library for your system.  
</ul>

\section config Configuring and building Trilinos with Amesos


You will need to add three switches to your configure invocation script.
<ul>
<li>Include the Amesos code in the configuration:  
<ul>
<li><b>--enable-amesos </b>
</ul>
<li>Enable one of the Amesos classes:
<ul>
<li><b>--enable-amesos-superlu</b> - Amesos_Superlu
<li><b>--enable-amesos-superludist </b> - Amesos_Superludist
<li><b>--enable-amesos-dscpack </b> -  Amesos_Dscpack
<li><b>--enable-amesos-umfpack </b> -  Amesos_Umfpack
</ul>
<li>Specify where to find the third party code in one of the following ways:
<ul>
<li><b>--with-trilinos3pldir=/home/somedir/Trilinos3PL</b>
<li><b>--with-amesos-sluddir=/home/somedir/SuperLU_DIST_2.0</b>
<li><b>--with-amesos-sludlib=/home/somedir/SuperLU_DIST_2.0/libsuperludist.a</b> <br>and <br><b>--with-amesos-sludincdir=/home/somedir/SuperLU_DIST_2.0/SRC</b>
</ul>
</ul>
By default, Amesos is built with KLU support. KLU is distributed with Amesos, and is automatically compiled when you compile Amesos (unless --disable-amesos-klu is specified).

<p>UMFPACK requires two libraries libumfpack.a and libamd.a.  If you
install UMFPACK in your Trilinos3PL directory using the directory
structure provided by UMFPACK, "--with-trilinos3pldir=" is sufficient.  If you 
install these libraries in other directories, you can use --with-amesos-umfpacklib= and  --with-amesos-umfpackamdlib= to specify those libraries. 

<p>MUMPS requires two libraries libdmumps.a and libpord.a.  If you
install MUMPS in your Trilinos3PL directory using the directory
structure provided by MUMPS, "--with-trilinos3pldir=" is sufficient.
If you install these libraries in other directories, you can use
--with-amesos-mumpslib= and --with-amesos-mumpspordlib= to specify
those libraries.  MUMPS also requires ScaLAPACK and BLACS libs.  Use
LIBS="" in the configuration script to specify the ScaLAPACK and BLACS 
libraries for inclusion in the link.  



\subsection testsuperludist  Testing Amesos with SuperLU distributed

<pre>
cd packages/amesos/test
source AmesosShortScript.exe
echo $status
</pre>

<p>In the 3.0.1 tar ball, the test will print a message upon success.  In the current development version of the code, under CVS control, the test is silent.  However there are two ways to test whether the test succeeded:
<ul>
<li>If the test passes, "echo $status" will return 0 
<li>Another way to check that this test passed is to compare the number of lines (the first number shown on the line) in each of the following two csh commands.  If this test was successful, OK will be printed once for each call to mpirun that is not in commented out, hence the following two calls to wc will show the same number of lines:
<pre>
grep OK SST.summary | wc
grep mpirun AmesosShortScript.exe | grep -v comment | wc
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Note: If AmesosShortScript.exe is not in amesos/test, it is likely that the make in the 
amesos/test directory failed.

<p>AmesosShellScript.exe contains a slightly longer test including larger matrices.

\subsection testsuperluserial  Testing Amesos with SuperLU serial

<p>Amesos as contained in the trilinos3.0.1 tar ball does not include a test for SuperLU serial.  

<p>AmesosShortSuperLU.exe, found only in the CVS repository at the moment, tests Amesos with SuperLU serial.  Follow the instruction for testing with SuperLU distributed above, using AmesosShortSuperLU.exe instead of AmesosShortScript.exe.


\subsection testdescpack  Testing Amesos with DSCPACK

<pre>
cd packages/amesos/test
source AmesosDscpackShort.exe
echo $status
</pre>

<ul>
<li>If the test passes, "echo $status" will return 0 
<li>Another way to check that this test passed is to compare the number of lines (the first number shown on the line) in each of the following two csh commands.  If this test was successful, OK will be printed once for each call to mpirun that is not in commented out, hence the following two calls to wc will show the same number of lines:
<pre>
grep OK SST.summary | wc
grep mpirun AmesosShortScript.exe | grep -v comment | wc
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Note: If AmesosDscpackShort.exe is not in amesos/test, it is likely that the make in the 
amesos/test directory failed.

<p>AmesosDscpack.exe contains a slightly longer test.

\subsection testumfpack  Testing Amesos with UMFPACK

<p>Amesos_Umfpack can be used with or without MPI.
AmesosUmfpackSerial.exe will test Amesos_Umfpack in serial mode.
AmesosUmfpack.exe will test Amesos_Umfpack as used with MPI (including 
tests of AmesosUmfpack on distributed matrices).

<pre>
cd packages/amesos/test
source AmesosUmfpackSerial.exe
echo $status
</pre>

<ul>
<li>If the test passes, "echo $status" will return 0 
<li>Another way to check that this test passed is to compare the number of lines (the first number shown on the line) in each of the following two csh commands.  If this test was successful, OK will be printed once for each call to mpirun that is not in commented out, hence the following two calls to wc will show the same number of lines:
<pre>
grep OK SST.summary | wc
grep mpirun AmesosUmfpack.exe | grep -v comment | wc
</pre>
</ul>

<p>AmesosUmfpack.exe tests Amesos_Umfpack built with MPI.  (UMFPACK is
a serial code, however Amesos_Umfpack accepts a distributed matrix as a convenience.) 

<p>Note: If AmesosDscpackShort.exe is not in amesos/test, it is likely that the make in the 
amesos/test directory failed.


\subsection bugs Known bugs

<ul>
<li> Amesos_Superludist
<ul>
<li><b>Superludist_2.0 tar file requires --with-amesos-sluddir=/home/somedir/SuperLU_DIST_2.0</b>.  By default, Amesos configuration assumes that you are using superlu_dist_1.0.tar which installs in SuperLU_DIST.  superlu_dist_2.0.tar installs in SuperLU_DIST_2.0.
