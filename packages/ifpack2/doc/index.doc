\mainpage Trilinos/Ifpack2: Incomplete factorizations, relaxations, and domain decomposition for Tpetra objects

\section Ifpack2_intro What is Ifpack2?

Ifpack2 provides incomplete factorizations, relaxations, and domain
decomposition operators for linear algebra objects (sparse matrices,
operators, and dense vectors and multivectors) provided by the Tpetra
package.  You may use these operators however you wish: for example as
preconditioners in an iterative solver, or as smoothers for algebraic
multigrid.

Ifpack2 aims at offering the same functionality as the Ifpack package,
though it does not promise backwards compatibility.  Ifpack only works
for Epetra linear algebra objects; Ifpack2 only works for Tpetra
objects.

\section Ifpack2_why Why Ifpack2?

Why do you want to use Ifpack2?  First, if you are using Tpetra, you
need to use Ifpack2 if you want incomplete factorizations,
relaxations, or domain decomposition.  Second, Ifpack2 gives you the
same advantages as Tpetra.  You can solve problems with more than two
billion unknowns, by using 64-bit global indices, yet save memory at
the same time by only storing 32-bit local indices.  You can use
matrices and vectors with any sensible data type, not just \c double.
For example, you can use \c float to save memory, or an
extended-precision type like <tt>dd_real</tt> or <tt>qd_real</tt> to
improve robustness for difficult problems.  Ifpack2 even works with
complex-valued data, like <tt>std::complex<float></tt> and
<tt>std::complex<double></tt>.  Finally, Ifpack2's algorithms use and
produce Tpetra objects, so you can exploit Tpetra's hybrid (MPI +
threads) parallelism features without effort.

\section Ifpack2_methods Methods that Ifpack2 implements

\subsection Ifpack2_methods_relax Relaxations and smoothers

Ifpack2 implements the following relaxations, smoothers, and related
preconditioners:
<ul>
<li> Diagonal scaling 
<li> Jacobi (with optional damping)
<li> Gauss-Seidel
<li> Successive Over-Relaxation (SOR)
<li> Symmetric versions of Gauss-Seidel and SOR
<li> Chebyshev iteration (as a smoother)
</ul>

Gauss-Seidel is actually a special case of SOR, when the damping
parameter \f$\omega = 1\f$.  Ifpack2 calls them both "Gauss-Seidel."
You may specify the sweep direction: forward, backward, or symmetric
(first forward, then backward).  We do not currently implement other
sweep directions or parallelization schemes (such as red-black
ordering), but you may reorder the rows yourself if you have a
specific sweep direction in mind.

Ifpack2's implementation of (Gauss-Seidel and) SOR is actually a
"hybrid" relaxation.  This means that it only performs SOR within an
MPI process, but does Jacobi-type updates between MPI processes.
While this can reduce effectiveness of the algorithms as
preconditioners or smoothers, Ifpack2 implements an "L1" option to
improve convergence despite this.  For details, please refer to the
following publication:

A. H. Baker, R. D. Falgout, T. V. Kolev, and U. M. Yang.
"Multigrid Smoothers for Ultraparallel Computing."
<i>SIAM J. Sci. Comput.</i>, Vol. 33, No. 5 (2011),
pp. 2864-2887.

For diagonal scaling, see the Ifpack2::Diagonal class.  The
Ifpack2::Relaxation class implements Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR, and
the symmetric variants of the latter two.  The Ifpack2::Chebyshev
class implements Chebyshev iteration.

\subsection Ifpack2_methods_fact Incomplete factorizations

Ifpack2 implements two different incomplete factorizations: ILUT
(Ifpack2::ILUT) and RILU(k) (Ifpack2::RILUK).  ILUT is a
threshold-based incomplete LU factorization, and RILU(k) is a
"relaxed" incomplete LU with level k fill.  

Both of these only perform the factorization on a matrix in a single
MPI process.

Our ILUT implementation factors each MPI process' part of the matrix
independently, and treats multiple processes via nonoverlapping domain
decomposition.  Our RILU(k) implementation's factorization reaches
across processes by overlapping off-process entries up to a specified
integer level of overlap, and factoring them redundantly on each
process.  For details on each algorithm and its options, please refer
to the specific class' documentation.  Also, for ILUT, please refer to
the following publication:

Youcef Saad, "ILUT: A dual threshold incomplete LU factorization,"
Numer. Linear Algebra Appl., Vol. 1 (1994), pp. 387-402.

\subsection Ifpack2_methods_dom Domain decomposition

Finally, Ifpack2 implements additive Schwarz domain decomposition, via
the Ifpack2::AdditiveSchwarz class.  The user may specify any
subdomain solver they wish.

\section Ifpack2_interface Interface to Ifpack2 methods

All Ifpack2 operators inherit from the base class
Ifpack2::Preconditioner.  This in turn inherits from Tpetra::Operator.
Thus, you may use an Ifpack2 operator anywhere that a Tpetra::Operator
works.  For example, you may use Ifpack2 operators directly as
preconditioners in Trilinos' Belos package of iterative solvers.

You may either create an Ifpack2 operator directly, by using the class
and options that you want, or by using Ifpack2::Factory.
Ifpack2::Factory is templated on a specialization of
Tpetra::CrsMatrix.  The Factory will use that template parameter to
get all the information that it needs to make a preconditioner of the
right type.  All the specific Ifpack2 operators are also templated on
a specialization of Tpetra::CrsMatrix.  Some of them only accept a
Tpetra::CrsMatrix instance as input, while others also may accept a
Tpetra::RowMatrix (the base class of Tpetra::CrsMatrix).  Some Ifpack2
methods prefer a Tpetra::CrsMatrix, because they can use faster
computational kernels in that case.  Those methods may try to guess
whether your Tpetra::RowMatrix is really a Tpetra::CrsMatrix.

\section Ifpack2_examples Examples

The ifpack2/test/belos directory includes a test program which shows
how to create Ifpack2 operators and use them as preconditioners with
Belos iterative solvers.  See belos_solve.cpp and
belos_extprec_solve.cpp in that directory.  The test program is
entirely driven by XML input files, which specify the matrix file to
be used, as well as parameters for the preconditioner, and the Belos
iterative solver type to use.

If you build Belos with examples enabled, the example will build as
Ifpack2_tif_belos.exe and will be installed in the
packages/ifpack2/test/belos directory.
