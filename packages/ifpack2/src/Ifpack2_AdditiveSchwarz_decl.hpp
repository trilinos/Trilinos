/** \class AdditiveSchwarz
\brief Additive Schwarz domain decomposition for Tpetra sparse matrices
\tparam MatrixType A specialization of Tpetra::RowMatrix
\tparam LocalInverseType The type of the solver for the local
  (subdomain) problem.  DO NOT USE ANY TYPE HERE OTHER THAN
  Ifpack2::Preconditioner.  The default is perfectly fine.  This
  template parameter only exists for backwards compatibility.

\section Ifpack2_AdditiveSchwarz_Summary Summary

This class implements Additive Schwarz domain decomposition, with
optional overlap.  It operates on a given Tpetra::RowMatrix.  Each
subdomain corresponds to exactly one MPI process in the given matrix's
MPI communicator.  For nonoverlapping domain decomposition
<i>within</i> an MPI process, please use BlockRelaxation.

This class is a subclass of Tpetra::Operator, like all other
subclasses of Preconditioner.  Thus, the apply() method applies the
preconditioner to a multivector.

\section Ifpack2_AdditiveSchwarz_Alg Algorithm

One-level overlapping domain decomposition preconditioners use local
solvers of Dirichlet type. This means that the solver effectively 
applies the inverse of the local matrix (possibly with overlap) 
to the residual to be preconditioned.

The preconditioner can be written as:
\f[
P_{AS}^{-1} = \sum_{i=1}^M P_i A_i^{-1} R_i,
\f]
where \f$M\f$ is the number of subdomains (in this case, the number of
(MPI) processes in the computation), \f$R_i\f$ is an operator that
restricts the global vector to the vector lying on subdomain \f$i\f$,
\f$P_i\f$ is the prolongator operator, and
\f[
A_i = R_i A P_i.
\f]

Constructing a Schwarz preconditioner takes two steps:
<ol>
<li> Definition of the restriction and prolongation operators </li>
<li> Definition of a solver for linear systems involving \f$A_i\f$ </li>
</ol>

The definition of the restriction and prolongation operators \f$R_i\f$
and \f$R_i^T\f$ depends on the level of overlap.  If the overlap level
is zero (no overlap), their implementation is trivial; \f$R_i\f$ will
return all the local components.  For nonzero overlap, Tpetra's data
redistribution facilities (Tpetra::Import) will be used to bring in
the required data.  Users may control how these data are combined with
existing data, by setting the combine mode parameter.  Valid combine
modes include "ADD", "INSERT", "REPLACE", "ABSMAX", and "ZERO".  These
correspond to the valid values of Tpetra::CombineMode.

To solve linear systems involving \f$A_i\f$ on each subdomain, the
user can adopt any subclass of Preconditioner.  Users must set this at
run time by specifying the inner solver in the ParameterList, or by
setting the inner solver instance explicitly.

The local matrix \f$A_i\f$ can be filtered, to eliminate singletons,
and reordered. At the present time, the only available reordering
algorithm is RCM (reverse Cuthill-Mckee). Other orderings
will be supported by the Zoltan2 package in the future.

\section Additive Schwarz algorithms supported

The default is Restricted Additive Schwarz
(RAS), which uses CombineMode Zero, see discussion below. Note that RAS
does not preserve symmetry, so is generally not suitable as
a preconditioner for CG.
Classical Additive Schwarz is supported by setting the
CombineMode to Add.

\section Ifpack2_AdditiveSchwarz_CombineMode Combine modes

AdditiveSchwarz supports different <i>combine modes</i>.  These are
rules for combining overlapping entries from the subdomain solves'
results, to form the final additive Schwarz result.  The two modes
that users will likely find most useful are "Add" and "Zero".  "Add"
sums overlapping results, and "Zero" ignores them.

The Zero combine mode can be a bit confusing.  It helps to compare the
Add combine mode without overlap, to the Zero combine mode with overlap.
Consider the following 4 x 4 linear system \f$Ax = b\f$, where
\f[
A =
\left(
\begin{array}{rrrr}
  2 & -1 &  0 &  0 \\
 -1 &  2 & -1 &  0 \\
  0 & -1 &  2 & -1 \\
  0 &  0 & -1 &  2
\end{array} \right)
\f]
and
\f[
b =
\left(
\begin{array}{rrrr}
  1 \\
  4 \\
  9 \\
 16
\end{array} \right)
.
\f]
Suppose that we give the first two rows of A and b to Process 0, and
the last two rows of A and b to Process 1.

If we use additive Schwarz without overlap, and use the Add
combine mode, then each process must solve a linear system with the
following 2 x 2 matrix:
\f[
A_{local} =
\left(
\begin{array}{rr}
  2 & -1 \\
 -1 &  2
\end{array} \right).
\f]
The inverse of this matrix is
\f[
A_{local}^{-1} =
\frac{1}{3} \cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{rr}
  2 &  1 \\
  1 &  2
\end{array} \right).
\f]

Process 0 gets the right-hand side \f$(1, 4)^T\f$ and thus the local
solution \f$(2, 3)^T\f$.  Process 1 gets the right-hand side \f$(9,
16)^T\f$ and thus the local solution \f$(34/3, 41/3)^T\f$.  The Add
combine mode sums entries corresponding to overlap, but in this case
there is no overlap, so we just concatenate the local results.  Thus,
the result of applying additive Schwarz once is
\f[
x_{Add} =
\begin{array}{r}
   2 \\
   3 \\
34/3 \\
41/3
\end{array}.
\f]

If we introduce one level of overlap on each of these processes, and
use the Zero combine mode with additive Schwarz, then each process has
to solve a linear system with the following 3 x 3 matrix:
\f[
A_{local} =
\left(
\begin{array}{rrr}
  2 & -1 &  0 \\
 -1 &  2 & -1 \\
  0 & -1 &  2
\end{array} \right).
\f]
The inverse of this matrix is
\f[
A_{local}^{-1} =
\frac{1}{4} \cdot
\left(
\begin{array}{rrr}
  3 &  2 &  1 \\
  2 &  4 &  2 \\
  1 &  2 &  3
\end{array} \right).
\f]
Process 0 gets the right-hand side \f$(1, 4, 9)^T\f$ and thus the
local solution \f$(5, 9, 9)^T\f$.  Process 1 gets the right-hand side
\f$(4, 9, 16)^T\f$ and thus the local solution \f$(23/2, 19,
35/2)^T\f$.  The Zero combine mode ignores "remote entries," so that
the result of applying additive Schwarz once is
\f[
x_{Zero} =
\begin{array}{r}
   5 \\
   9 \\
  19 \\
35/2
\end{array}.
\f]

Even though both of the above examples combine the local results in
the same way, Zero produces a different final result than Add, because
the Zero example uses overlap 1, whereas the Add example uses overlap 0.

\section Ifpack2_AdditiveSchwarz_subdomain Subdomain solver

This class gives you two ways to specify the subdomain solver.  First,
you may set the "subdomain solver name" or "inner preconditioner name"
parameters in the input to setParameters() or setParameterList().
Second, you may construct the subdomain solver yourself, as an
Ifpack2::Preconditioner instance, and give it to setInnerPreconditioner().

Please refer to the documentation of setParameters for a complete
discussion of subdomain solvers and their parameters.

  /// \subsection Ifpack2_AS_setParams_subd_inner Subdomain solver parameters and setInnerPreconditioner
  ///
  /// Users are responsible for ensuring that the parameters they
  /// provide to setParameters() are up to date.  For example, if the
  /// users first set an inner preconditioner using
  /// setInnerPreconditioner(), and then call setParameters() with the
  /// "inner preconditioner name" parameter set, AdditiveSchwarz will
  /// get rid of the users' inner preconditioner and attempt to create
  /// a new inner preconditioner itself.  Remember that
  /// AdditiveSchwarz's ParameterList has "delta" (relative)
  /// semantics!  If you don't specify a parameter, the current state
  /// is not changed.
  ///
  /// If you specify a sublist of parameters to give to the subdomain
  /// solver, setInnerPreconditioner() does <i>not</i> pass that
  /// sublist to its argument.  This is because we presume that if you
  /// call setInnerPreconditioner(), the input subdomain solver
  /// probably has a type that AdditiveSchwarz does not know how to
  /// create by itself, so the existing parameter list cannot apply.
  ///
  /// On the other hand, if, after calling setInnerPreconditioner(),
  /// you then call setParameters(), we <i>do</i> pass any provided
  /// sublist of subdomain solver parameters to the inner solver.  If
  /// no such sublist was provided, we do <i>not</i> call
  /// setParameters() on the inner solver.
  ///
  /// The reason the last sentence matters is because not every inner
  /// solver necessarily has "delta" semantics for setParameters().
  /// "Delta" or "relative" semantics means that an empty input
  /// ParameterList doesn't change any existing parameters.
  /// "Non-delta" or "absolute" semantics means that an empty input
  /// ParameterList causes all parameters to be set to their default
  /// values.  (The difference matters if the user has called
  /// setParameters() before on the subdomain solver, with nondefault
  /// values.)  If the user didn't specify a sublist for the inner
  /// solver, we assume that the user doesn't want to change the inner
  /// solver's parameters.
