/// \brief Create overlapping partitions of a local graph.
/// \tparam GraphType Specialization of Tpetra::CrsGraph or
///   Tpetra::RowGraph.
///
/// This class enables the extension of nonoverlapping partitions to
/// an arbitrary amount of constant overlap.  "Overlap" here refers to the
/// overlap among the local parts, and not the overlap among the
/// processes.
///
/// For partitions with varying overlap, use UserPartitioner, which inherits
/// from OverlappingPartitioner.
///
/// Supported parameters are:
/// - "partitioner: local parts" (<tt>local_ordinal_type</tt>): the
///   number of local partitions.  Default is one (one local
///   partition, which means "do not partition locally").
/// - "partitioner: overlap" (int): the amount of overlap between
///   partitions.  Default is zero (no overlap).
///
/// This class implements common functionality for derived classes
/// like LinearPartitioner.  Graphs given as input to any derived
/// class must contain no singletons.  Usually, this means that the
/// graph is the graph of a Tpetra::RowMatrix that has been filtered
/// using SingletonFilter.
