/// \class Chebyshev
/// \brief Left-scaled Chebyshev iteration.
/// \tparam ScalarType The type of entries in the matrix and vectors.
/// \tparam MV Specialization of Tpetra::MultiVector.
///
/// \warning This class is NOT for users; it is an implementation
///   detail of Ifpack2.  Users should use Ifpack2::Chebyshev instead.
///
/// This class implements two variants of Chebyshev iteration:
/// <ol>
/// <li> A direct imitation of Ifpack's implementation </li>
/// <li> A textbook version of the algorithm </li>
/// </ol>
///
/// All implemented variants use the diagonal of the matrix to
/// precondition the linear system on the left.  %Diagonal entries less
/// than machine precision are replaced with machine precision.
///
/// The first version imitates Ifpack_Chebyshev, both in how it sets
/// parameters and in the actual iteration (ApplyInverse()).  The
/// "textbook" in variant #2 above is "Templates for the Solution of
/// Linear Systems," 2nd edition.  Experiments show that the Ifpack
/// imitation is much less sensitive to the eigenvalue bounds than the
/// textbook version, so users should prefer it.  (In fact, it is the
/// default.)
///
/// We require that the matrix A be real valued and symmetric positive
/// definite.  If users could provide the ellipse parameters ("d" and
/// "c" in the literature, where d is the real-valued center of the
/// ellipse, and d-c and d+c the two foci), the iteration itself would
/// work fine with nonsymmetric real-valued A, as long as the
/// eigenvalues of A can be bounded in an ellipse that is entirely to
/// the right of the origin.
///
/// There is also dead code for imitating ML's Chebyshev
/// implementation (ML_Cheby(), in
/// packages/ml/src/Smoother/ml_smoother.c).  I couldn't get it to
/// converge in time to be useful for testing, so it is disabled.

  /// \section Ifpack2_Details_Chebyshev_setParameters_List List of parameters
  ///
  /// Parameters that govern spectral bounds of the matrix:
  /// - "chebyshev: max eigenvalue" (\c ScalarType): lambdaMax, an
  ///   upper bound of the bounding ellipse of the eigenvalues of the
  ///   matrix A.  If you do not set this parameter, we will compute
  ///   an approximation.  See "Parameters that govern eigenvalue
  ///   analysis" to control this approximation process.
  /// - "chebyshev: ratio eigenvalue" (\c ScalarType): eigRatio, the
  ///   ratio of lambdaMax to the lower bound of the bounding ellipse
  ///   of the eigenvalues of A.  We use lambdaMax and eigRatio to
  ///   determine the Chebyshev iteration coefficients.  This
  ///   parameter is optional and defaults to 30.
  /// - "chebyshev: min eigenvalue" (\c ScalarType): lambdaMin, a
  ///   lower bound of real part of bounding ellipse of eigenvalues of
  ///   the matrix A.  This parameter is optional and only used for a
  ///   quick check if the matrix is the identity matrix (if lambdaMax
  ///   == lambdaMin == 1).
  ///
  /// Parameters that govern the number of Chebyshev iterations:
  /// - "chebyshev: degree" (\c int): numIters, the number of
  ///   iterations.  This overrides "relaxation: sweeps" and
  ///   "smoother: sweeps" (see below).
  /// - "relaxation: sweeps" (\c int): numIters, the number of
  ///   iterations.  We include this for compatibility with Ifpack.
  ///   This overrides "smoother: sweeps" (see below).
  /// - "smoother: sweeps" (\c int): numIters, as above.
  ///   We include this for compatibility with ML.
  ///
  /// Parameters that govern eigenvalue analysis:
  /// - "chebyshev: eigenvalue max iterations" (\c int): eigMaxIters,
  ///   the number of power method iterations used to compute the
  ///   maximum eigenvalue.  This overrides "eigen-analysis:
  ///   iterations" (see below).
  /// - "eigen-analysis: iterations" (\c int): eigMaxIters, as above.
  ///   We include this parameter for compatibility with ML.
  /// - "eigen-analysis: type" (<tt>std::string</tt>): The algorithm
  ///   to use for estimating the max eigenvalue.  This parameter is
  ///   optional.  Currently, we only support "power-method" (or
  ///   "power method"), which is what Ifpack::Chebyshev uses for
  ///   eigenanalysis.  We include this parameter for compatibility
  ///   with ML.
  ///
  /// Parameters that govern other algorithmic details:
  /// - "chebyshev: assume matrix does not change": Whether compute()
  ///   should always assume that the matrix has not changed since the
  ///   last call to compute().  The default is false.  If true,
  ///   compute() will not recompute the inverse diagonal or the
  ///   estimates of the max and min eigenvalues.  compute() will
  ///   always compute any quantity which the user did not provide and
  ///   which we have not yet computed before.
  /// - "chebyshev: operator inv diagonal" (<tt>RCP<const V></tt> or
  ///   <tt>const V*</tt>): If nonnull, we will use a deep copy of
  ///   this vector for left scaling as the inverse diagonal of the
  ///   matrix A, instead of computing the inverse diagonal ourselves.
  ///   We will make a copy every time you call setParameters().  If
  ///   you ever call setParameters() without this parameter, we will
  ///   clear our copy and compute the inverse diagonal ourselves
  ///   again.  If you choose to provide this parameter, you are
  ///   responsible for updating this if the matrix has changed.
  /// - "chebyshev: min diagonal value" (\c ST): minDiagVal.  If any
  ///   entry of the diagonal of the matrix is less than this in
  ///   magnitude, it will be replaced with this value in the inverse
  ///   diagonal used for left scaling.
  /// - "chebyshev: zero starting solution" (\c bool): If true, then
  ///   always use the zero vector(s) as the initial guess(es).  If
  ///   false, then apply() will use X on input as the initial
  ///   guess(es).
  ///
  /// Parameters that govern backwards compatibility:
  /// - "chebyshev: textbook algorithm" (\c bool): If true, use the
  ///   textbook version of Chebyshev iteration.  We recommend against
  ///   this, since the default algorithm is less sensitive to the
  ///   quality of the eigenvalue bounds.
  /// - "chebyshev: compute max residual norm" (\c bool): If true,
  ///   apply() will compute and return the max (absolute) residual
  ///   norm.  Otherwise, apply() returns 0.  This defaults to false.
  ///
  /// The above compatibility parameters are not exposed in the
  /// documentation of Ifpack2::Chebyshev, because they are more
  /// useful to Ifpack2 developers than to users.
  ///
  /// \pre lambdaMin, lambdaMax, and eigRatio are real
  /// \pre 0 < lambdaMin <= lambdaMax
  /// \pre numIters >= 0
  /// \pre eigMaxIters >= 0
