**FLOW-OPT**

The **flow-opt** suite of PDE-constrained optimization applications
is a research effort to enable porosity optimization for chemical
engineering applications.

There are two main physics modules, *3dim* and *axisymmetric*.
The *3dim* module contains three-dimensional models and represents an
experimental effort.  The *axisymmetric* module has two experimental
modules, *darcy* and *brinkman*.  The third module, called

  *filteredDarcy*

is a mature effort, used to design spatially varying porosity profiles
in columns that can be additively manufactured (printed in three
dimensions) and are used for chemical reactions.  This module
accompanies the paper

H. Antil, D. P. Kouri, D. Ridzal, D. B. Robinson, M. Salloum (2022),
_Uniform flow in axisymmetric devices through permeability optimization_.
