# This example shows how to redistribute Epetra distributed objects.
#
# The example creates two maps. The first map has all the elements on
# processor 0 only, the second has a linear distribution, so that 
# approximatively the same number of elements is given to each processor.
# Then, an Epetra.Import object is created, and used to move elements from
# a vector defined on processor 0 only, to a distributed vector.
# 
# This example should be run with more than one processor
