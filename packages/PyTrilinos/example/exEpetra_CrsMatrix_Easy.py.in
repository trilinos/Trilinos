  # `0' means to allocate for 0 elements on each row (better estimates make the
  # code faster). `NumMyElements' is the number of rows that are locally hosted 
  # by the calling processor; `MyGlobalElements' is the global ID of locally 
  # hosted rows.

  # - if you ask for a non-valid element, the returned value is 0.0

# This is a standard Python construct.  Put the code to be executed in a
# function [typically main()] and then use the following logic to call the
# function if the script has been called as an executable from the UNIX
# command
# line.  This also allows, for example, this file to be imported from a python
# debugger and main() called from there.
