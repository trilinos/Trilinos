  # `0' means to allocate for 0 elements on each row (better estimates make the

  # IDs for rows and columns. However, you can only set *local* rows. When the

  # - you must first call FillComplete()
  # - if you ask for a non-valid element, the returned value is 0.0
  # - only elements in local rows can be queried.

# This is a standard Python construct.  Put the code to be executed in a
# function [typically main()] and then use the following logic to call the
# function if the script has been called as an executable from the UNIX
# command
# line.  This also allows, for example, this file to be imported from a python
# debugger and main() called from there.
