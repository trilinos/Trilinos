# Imports.  Users importing an installed version of PyTrilinos should use the
# "from PyTrilinos import ..." syntax.  Here, the setpath module adds the build
# directory, including "PyTrilinos", to the front of the search path.  We thus
# use "import ..." for Trilinos modules.  This prevents us from accidentally
# picking up a system-installed version and ensures that we are testing the
# build module.

# This is a standard Python construct.  Put the code to be executed in a
# function [typically main()] and then use the following logic to call the
# function if the script has been called as an executable from the UNIX command
# line.  This also allows, for example, this file to be imported from a python
# debugger and main() called from there.
