    Return the requested PyTrilinos module.  Argument 'name' must be a valid
    PyTrilinos module name, such as 'Teuchos', Epetra', 'AztecOO', etc.  If
    argument 'fromBuild' is False, then this function returns what would be
    obtained from the statement 'from PyTrilinos import <name>', which in all
    liklihood will be a system-installed version of PyTrilinos.  If it is True,
    the function ensures that the module that gets returned is from the local
    build directory.

    fromPyTrilinosImport() is designed to work from the local build directory,
    whether that directory is an autotools build directory, or a cmake build
    directory.
