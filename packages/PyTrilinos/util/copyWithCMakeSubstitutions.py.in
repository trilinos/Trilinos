copyWithCMakeSubstitutions.py - This script is intended to be run as a script.
Its purpose is to copy a file from one location to another, and substitute
instances of '${VAR_NAME}' with the value of variable VAR_NAME, which comes from
the local build tree's CMakeCache.txt file.  If VAR_NAME is not a variable name
within the cache file, then substitute the null string.
