class PropertyBase(object):
    """
    PropertyBase is a base class for simple property classes that have a
    restricted set of property names and type-checked property values.  To
    define a property class, do the following:

      1. Define a class that inherits from PropertyBase
      2. Add a static data member named 'props', which is a dictionary.  Its
         keys should be valid property names, and its values should specify the
         type of the corresponding property.  This type specification can be a
         type object, or a sequence of objects which define an enumeration.
      3. Optionally define a static data member named 'defaults', with all or a
         subset of the 'props' keys, and default values for those properties.
         Keys in 'defaults' but not in 'props' will cause an AttributeError
         exception to be raised, and values in 'defaults' that are of the wrong
         type will cause a TypeError exception to be raised.  Properties not
         specified in 'defaults' will default to None. 
      4. Define the derived constructor such that it calls the base constructor:
           def __init__(self, **kwargs):
               PropertyBase.__init__(self, **kwargs)

    And that is it.  As an example, if we wanted a class that kept track of the
    name, author, number of pages and price of a book:

      >>> class BookProperties(PropertyBase):
      ...     props = {'name':str, 'author':str, 'pages':int, 'price':float}
      ...     defaults = {'price' : 9.99 }
      ...     def __init__(self, **kwargs):
      ...         PropertyBase.__init__(self, **kwargs)
      ... 
      >>> bookProps = BookProperties(name='A Tale of Two Cities')
      >>> bookProps.author = 'Charles Dickens'
      >>> print(bookProps)
      price = 9.9900000000000002
      pages = None
      name = 'A Tale of Two Cities'
      author = 'Charles Dickens'
      >>>
    """
