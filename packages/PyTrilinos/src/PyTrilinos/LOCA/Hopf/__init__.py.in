PyTrilinos.LOCA.Hopf is the python interface to namespace Hopf of the
Trilinos continuation algorithm package LOCA:

    https://trilinos.org/docs/dev/packages/nox/doc/html/index.html

The purpose of LOCA.Hopf is to provide groups and vectors for Hopf
bifurcations.  The python version of LOCA.Hopf supports the following
sub-modules:

    * MooreSpence         - Groups and vectors for locating Hopf bifurcations
                            using the Moore-Spence formulation
    * MinimallyAugmented  - Groups and vectors for locating Hopf bifurcations
                            using the minimally augmented Hopf formulation

and classes:

    * ComplexMultiVector  - Multi-vector class to hold two multi-vectors to
                            represent a complex multi-vector
    * ComplexVector       - Vector class to hold two vectors to represent a
                            complex vector
"""

# We need to avoid the following being generated by SWIG:
#
#     class LOCA_Hopf_Class(__init__.BaseClass):
#
# So we put all of the classes, etc., that would logically go into this
# __init__.py file into a sub-module called "Base". SWIG will then generate
#
#     class LOCA_Hopf_Class(Base.BaseClass):
#
# and to make that work, we just import the Base module:
from . import Base

# Users, on the other hand, don't want to reference LOCA.Hopf.Base, because
# the Base namespace is not a part of Trilinos. Users want to do this:
#
#    class MyClass(LOCA.Hopf.BaseClass):
#
# and we make that work by creating a reference to all of the symbols in Base
# in this module, while preserving certain special variables:
this_name = __name__
this_doc  = __doc__
this_file = __file__
try:
    this_cached = __cached__
    this_loader = __loader__
    this_spec   = __spec__
except NameError:
    pass

globals().update(Base.__dict__)

__name__ = this_name
__doc__  = this_doc
__file__ = this_file
try:
    __cached__ = this_cached
    __loader__ = this_loader
    __spec__   = this_spec
except NameError:
    pass

# Note that this infrastructure means that LOCA.Base.Name and LOCA.Name
# are both references to the same object.

# Take care of importing all other sub-modules
__all__ = ['MooreSpence',
           'MinimallyAugmented'
           ]
from . import MooreSpence
from . import MinimallyAugmented
