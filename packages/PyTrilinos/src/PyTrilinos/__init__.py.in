PyTrilinos: A python interface to selected Trilinos packages.  This installation
  of PyTrilinos was built with the following python-wrapped packages enabled:

# We need symbol names to be recognized across PyTrilinos extension modules.  On
# some systems, this requires that the dynamic library opener be given certain
# flags: runtime load now and runtime load global.  This has to be set before
# any PyTrilinos extension modules are loaded.  Unfortunately, the python module
# we want that contains the named values of these flags is called "dl" on some
# systems, "DLFCN" on others, and does not even exist on some.  The following
# logic loads the module into name "dl" if it exists and extracts the needed
# flags.  If the module we need does not exist, we use our best guess at what
# the flags values are.  After all this, the sys module setdlopenflags()
# function is called.
dl = None
