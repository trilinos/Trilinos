PyTrilinos Documentation System
===============================

Python Docstrings
-----------------

Python has an effective interactive documentation system, utilizing
what are known as "docstrings".  If the first statement of a python
module, a python function or a python class is a string constant, then
that string becomes the documentation string, or "docstring", for the
given module, function or class.  For example,

::

    def func(arg):
        "Docstring for function func"
        return "Hello, world!"

Docstrings are fundamentally different from python comments, because
of their position relative to the code they describe and because they
are used by the python ``help`` facility and other documentation
tools, such as ``pydoc``::

    >>> help(func)
    Help on function func in module __main__:

    func(arg)
        Docstring for function func
    >>>

PyTrilinos Docstring Policy
---------------------------

It is the policy of PyTrilinos that python docstrings should be
maintained to provide useful, current and accurate information to
PyTrilinos users that

    * correctly reflect the calling arguments of PyTrilinos methods
      and functions,

    * match the coresponding doxygen documentation provided by
      Trilinos developers when appropriate, and

    * supercede the doxygen documentation when the python interface
      and/or implementation is different from the C++ interface and/or
      implementation.

The difficulty in adhering to these policies is that the python code
(and therefore the python docstrings) that makes up PyTrilinos is
automatically generated by swig.  Fortunately, there are several tools
available that allow these policies to be met.

Module docstrings
-----------------

Every PyTrilinos module should contain a module docstring.  This is
typically implemented in the package interface file as follows::

    %define %my_package_docstring
    "
    Multi-line documentation string for
    My_Package
    "
    %enddef
    %module (docstring = %my_package_docstring) My_Package

SWIG does not require that SWIG macro names begin with "``%``", but it
is allowed and it is the convention for PyTrilinos SWIG macros.
Further, PyTrilinos module docstrings follow a set format::

    PyTrilinos.My_Package is the python interface to the Trilinos
    such-and-such package My_Package:

        http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/my_package

    The purpose of My_Package is to . . . .  The python version of the
    My_Package package supports the following classes:

        * Class1          - Short description 1
        * Class2          - Short description 2
        * ...

    Any other notes about the package as a whole. . . .

Function and Method Docstrings
------------------------------

Docstrings for functions and methods are partially implemented by the
SWIG ``%feature`` called ``autodoc``.  Before any code is directed to
be wrapped within an interface file (by the first ``%include``
directive), the following feature should be activated::

    %feature("autodoc", "1");

This automatically adds docstrings to each function and class method
showing the function name, argument list, and return type.  The
argument list contains both type and name information (as per the
``"1"`` option).  If a function or method is overloaded, each valid
calling signature is listed.

Appending Doxygen Documentation to Docstrings
---------------------------------------------

A system is in place for automatically extracting Doxygen
documentation from a Trilinos package source code and inserting it
into the package's python module.  First, Doxygen is used to extract
the documentation and save it in XML format.  Second, a python script
is run to read this XML data and convert it to a series of valid SWIG
statements of the form:::

    %feature("docstring") <symbol-name> <docstring>

Third, each package interface file implements an ``%include``
statement to read these documentation directives.  This adds the
Doxygen documentation string to the end of the string created by
``%feature("autodoc", "1")``.

All of this infrastructure is contained within the PyTrilinos
subdirectory::

    doc/Doxygen

Within this subdirectory are a series of Doxygen control files, one
for each package: ``Doxyfile_Teuchos``, ``Doxyfile_Epetra``, etc.
These Doxyfiles have certain features in common: they all generate XML
output:: 

    GENERATE_XML = YES

while suppressing all other forms of output.  They all direct output
to their own subdirectory::

    OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = Teuchos
    XML_OUTPUT = .

If you add documentation for a new package, then add the package name
to the ``PyTrilinos/doc/Doxygen/Makefile`` variable ``PACKAGES``.
When you run ``make`` from the shell, this will cause ``doxygen`` to
be run on the Doxyfile and the script ``doxy2swig.py`` (generously
provided by Prabhu Ramachandran) to be run on the resulting output.
This produces a file with a ``_dox.i`` suffix, e.g. ``Teuchos_dox.i``,
intended to be included into the package interface file
``src/Teuchos.i``.  To facilitate this inclusion, SWIG is invoked with
``-I$(top_srcdir)/doc/Doxygen``.  See ``config/swig.am`` for details.

Overriding Doxygen Documentation
--------------------------------

Sometimes the Doxygen documentation is not appropriate for a given
python function or method.  This is often the case when ``%typemap``-s
are employed or when the python implementation replaces the C++
interface by using ``%ignore``, ``%extend`` and/or ``%inline``.  This
requires that the automatically created docstrings be overridden or
appended, and can be accomplished by providing a SWIG documentation
directive *after* the ``%include "Teuchos_dox.i"`` (for example) and
that redefines the docstring for a specified symbol.  These directives
should be placed directly in the appropriate interface file.  By
convention, all directives pertaining to the symbols within a single
``%include`` file are grouped together.  The documentation directives
should be at the tops of these groupings.

There are two SWIG documentation directives that can be employed to
override or append docstrings.  If you wish to append documentation to
what is already present, use::

    %feature("docstring")
    <symbol-name>
    "
    <docstring>
    ";

If you wish to replace the existant docstring completely, use the
directive::

    %feature("autodoc",
    "<docstring>")
    <symbol-name>;

The formatting given here tends to be the most readable for the widest
range of situations, both for the interface files and for the
resulting docstrings.
