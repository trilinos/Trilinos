:Abstract: PyTrilinos is a python interface to selected Trilinos
    packages.  The Trilinos Project is a collection of over 30
    software packages written primarily in C++ that provide linear-,
    nonlinear-, and eigen-solvers, along with preconditioners and
    supporting utilities, that are object-oriented, parallel and
    serial, for sparse and dense problems.  PyTrilinos is one of those
    packages, and provides python interfaces to the most popular and
    important Trilinos packages.  This Guide provides information,
    both necessary and recommended, for developing PyTrilinos
    packages.
