\section piro_disclaimer  Disclaimer for Beta-Release in Trilinos 11.2
%Piro is an immature package that was released for the
first time as part of Trilinos 10.2 in March-April 2010.
At this point, any expectations of documentation, full algorithmic
coverage, and backward-compatibility should be limited.

\section piro_intro Introduction

%Piro is the top-level, unifying package of the Embedded Nonlinear
Analysis Capability area. The main purpose of the package is to
provide driver classes for the common uses of Trilinos nonlinear
analysis tools. These so-called <em>Solvers</em> all can be constructed similarly,
with a <em>Model Evaluator</em> and a parameter list, to make it simple to
switch between different types of analysis.
As <em>Reponse-Only Model Evaluators</em>, they also all derive
from the same base classes so that the resulting analysis
can in turn be driven by non-intrusive analysis routines.

The name %Piro is an acronym for "Parameters In -- Responses Out,"
which is a Tarzan-grammar description of the abstraction for
a solved forward problem.
It also is the name of a Native American Pueblo originally
located near present day Socorro, New Mexico.

\section piro_overview Piro Description

%Piro attempts to unify the usage of the nonlinear analysis
capabilities in Trilinos. It requires that the application
code present itself using the ModelEvaluator interface
abstraction (either the Thyra or EpetraExt version).
The %Piro solvers can be constructed using just an instance of
<tt>Thyra::ModelEvaluator</tt> (or <tt>EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator</tt>)
and a <tt>Teuchos::ParameterList</tt>, and then
can be solved with a single <tt>evalModel</tt> call.
Alternatively, these solvers can be constructed via
a \link Piro::SolverFactory factory\endlink for Thyra-based models,
or its Epetra \link Piro::Epetra::SolverFactory counterpart\endlink.

The nonlinear analysis tools that are (or will be) wrapped
by %Piro include:
<ul>
<li>NOX: Nonlinear Solver
<li>LOCA: Continuation and Bifurcation Analysis Solver
<li>Rythmos: Transient DAE solver
<li>Stokhos: Embedded UQ solver for Stochastic-Galerkin over random variables
<li>MOOCHO: Emebedded Optimization algorithms with rSQP algorithms
<li>LIME: Algorithms for multi-physics coupling (under development)
</ul>

Each of these solvers not only takes a ModelEvaluator as
the interface to the application code, but also itself
inherits from the ModelEvaluator interface. These are
of the ResponseOnlyModelEvaluator variety (which is
currently a class in Thyra, but just a useful
description for EpetraExt). A ResponseOnlyModelEvaluator
takes parameters as inputs and produces
responses as output (hence the PIRO acronym). In general,
it may also produce gradients of the response with respect
to the parameters, and, in the future, Hessians.

As a ResponseOnlyModelEvaluator, any %Piro solver will
satisfy the interface for non-intrusive optimization
and UQ algorithms. In Trilinos, these include:
<ul>
<li>OptiPack: Distributed memory optimization algorithms with line searches
<li>MOOCHO: Distributed memory SQP methods with constraints
<li>Dakota via %TriKota: The entire Dakota framework
(developed at Sandia independently from Trilinos) is available
through the adapters and build system of the %TriKota package.
</ul>


\section piro_use Piro Use Case

To get concrete, here is a typical use case (which can be seen
in the test directory).
<ul>
<li> Wrap your application code in an <tt>EpetraExt::ModelEvaluator</tt>,
taking a solution vector and parameters as input, and producing
a residual vector, Jacobian, and response (interpreted as an objective function).
<li> Construct this model, and use it and a parameter list
(specified in an XML file) to construct a \link Piro::Epetra::NOXSolver NOXSolver\endlink.
<li> Call the \link Piro::Epetra::PerformAnalysis analysis driver\endlink
with this solver and a parameter list to perform optimization of this model.
<li> Add support for time dependence to your model, construct
the \link Piro::Epetra::RythmosSolver RythmosSolver\endlink instead,
and repeat optimization for transient application.
</ul>

\section piro_me  Model Evaluator Confusion

The design of %Piro leads to confusion, because the ModelEvaluator
is the interface abstraction at two levels. The full ModelEvaluator
(that takes a statevector as input and returns a residual) is the
abstraction around the users application. The %Piro Solvers (typically
nonlinear or transient) eliminate the statevector so that the residual
is satisfied, and present themselves as a ModelEvaluator as well
(in this case, the ResponseOnly variety) for non-intrusive algorithms.

This design allows for flexibility, particularly in expanding this
coupling beyond two levels. For instance, multi-physics coupling
algorithms can combine separate models into a single coupled model.
A UQ study of a coupled model with transient heat transfer and
quasi-steady fluid flow, could involve ModelEvaluators at 4 levels,
and not just two.

\section piro_help Piro Contacts

%Piro is developed by Andy Salinger, Roscoe Bartlett, Todd Coffey,
Roger Pawlowski, and Eric Phipps. Much of the code is adapted from
tests and examples for NOX, LOCA, Rythmos, Stokhos, MOOCHO,
OptiPack, and %TriKota, and was developed and matured in the Albany
application code before being library-ized into %Piro.
