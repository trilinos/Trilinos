===================
 Amesos2 TODO List
===================

- Finish KLU2 so it works for all types. May require third template parameter.
- Wish list: CholMod, UMFPACK, SuiteSparseQR, Pastix, MUMPS

OLD TODO (some of these have been fixed)
========================================

 - Remove Amesos2_ENABLE_XXXX configure options in CMakeLists.txt
   because they are auto-generated from the Dependencies file. (DONE)

 - When refreshing the internal values of A, need to check that the
   dimensions still line up, and if not, resize internal arrays and
   variables. (DONE)
   
 - Validate and give doc strings to parameterlists
 
 - In our general solver test framework, add an option to run multiple
   factorizations and solves in sequence.  The option would make the
   test do a sequence like::

     symb -> num -> solve -> num -> solve -> solve

   or something similar (DONE)
   
 - Make the B argument for solve_impl and solve(X,B) a Ptr to a const
   MV adapter.  This might mean we have to follow through to some
   downstream functions to make them take const arguments also (or
   make member functions const when appropriate). (DONE, also extended
   this const'ness to the `create' method and all matrix args)
   
 - May be useful to define some Amesos2 exception classes?

 - Update the NewSolver and NewAdapter templates in examples/ 

 - Change namespace to "Amesos2" (DONE)

 - setParameters should use the default parameter interface provided
   by ParameterList.  This should make the effect of multiple
   setParameters calls non-cumulative (which is how most packages
   treat this function).

 - Add cases to unit tests where the matrix is empty on some
   processors before calling solve().  This was suggested by David Day
   since this case has a tendency to expose bugs.

 - Remove the printStatus method. (DONE)

 - LAPACK support (ScaLAPACK would be nice, but more involved.  Only
   upon request). (LAPACK DONE)

 - Add Amesos2_ENABLE_Timers option which is off by default.  Will
   have to put ifdef guards around all timer activity. (DONE)

 - Add Amesos2 parameter "Memory" which has two possible values "safe"
   and "optimized".  The "optimized" option will tell the Amesos2
   solver that it can release it's hold on the matrix RCP as soon as
   numeric factorization has been performed.

 - Give the setA() method an additional parameter, which will be a
   state that should be kept within the solver object.  For example
   setA(newA,SYMBFACT) will direct the solver to replace A with newA,
   but instead of resetting everything, should set the solver state
   such that it is the same as if a symbolic factorization had just
   been performed.  The default value for the second parameter would
   be something like "FRESH", "CLEAN", or "NONE" to indicate that no
   computation has been performed.  (DONE)

 - Provide an Amesos2 "Status" object to users through a
   solver->getStatus() method.  The status should hold things such as

   + number of non-zeros in the L and U factors
   + number of solves, numeric and symbolic facts, and preOrderings
   + the current phase (i.e. which was the last phase to complete)
   
   The concrete solver interfaces can set the values for the L and U
   nnz.  I think it would be best to provide a method in the status
   object for setting these values, rather than calling a function in
   the interface.  That way, if a solver does not yet want to support
   that feature, or is unable to support that feature (e.g. MUMPS),
   then we do not have to burden the developer with stubbing out the
   method.  The solver interface can then just call the method when
   they want to.

   A lot of status machinery exists already in the Amesos::Status
   class, but it was designed mostly for internal use.  It could just
   be cleaned up and made ready for use by users. (DONE)

 - Abstract the matrix loading/reading process/decisions into the
   SolverCore class.  SolverCore should declare and define a private
   (or perhaps public) method called `loadA()'.  This method will be
   called from within the computational methods whenever it is decided
   that the internal solver data of matrix A should be refreshed.  In
   general, this is upon every call to preOrdering,
   symbolicFactorization, or numericFactorization.  In certain
   circumstances, in particular whenever a method calls its
   predecessor because it has not been done yet (e.g. numeric calling
   symbolic).

   The solver interfaces then define a `loadA_impl()' method that
   actually handles loading the matrix data into internal
   structures. (DONE)

 - Pull out many of the type and enum declarations from the Util::
   namespace and header files.  Put them in an Amesos2_TypesDecl.hpp
   header and in the Amesos2:: namespace to be used when
   needed. (DONE)

 - Throw error if a user tries to create a solver with an unsupported
   type.  This will require a bit more meta-programming than we
   currently have.  Pulling our meta-programming functions out of Util
   might also be good.  (DONE)

 - The Amesos2::query function may also want template parameters so
   that we can also tell the user if a solver does not support a
   scalar type.  Have it return true only in the case where the solver
   is enabled *and* it supports the types of the Matrix and Vector
   template parameters. (NO, we will leave it as is)

 Some things worth considering
-------------------------------


Matrix Adapters
===============

something small first (DONE)
---------------------

The Tpetra MatrixAdapters need to move to something more like how the
Epetra matrix adapters are declared/defined.  It's not so much of an
issue right now (Tue Jul 20 13:30:05 CDT 2010), since Tpetra has only
one class implemented that implements the ``Tpetra::RowMatrix``
interface.  Once more come along though, the change should be made.

The reason that we do need to explicitely define a template
specialization for each class that implements/inherits from
``Tpetra::RowMatrix``, is that class templates are blind to
polymorphism.  A ``MatrixAdapter<Tpetra::CrsMatrix>`` cannot be
interpreted as a ``MatrixAdapter<Tpetra::RowMatrix>`` even though a
``Tpetra::CrsMatrix`` object could be interpreted at runtime as a
``Tpetra::RowMatrix``.  At compile time they are just recognized as
completely different types.


something more involved (DONE)
-----------------------

Currently, we have ``getCrs()`` and ``getCcs()`` defined entirely in
each MatrixAdapter specialization.  This was OK at first with
``Tpetra::CrsMatrix``, but then, once I added the adapter for
``Epetra_RowMatrix``, I noticed that essentially the only thing that
needed changing with the part where the global row values are fetched.

So, it would be beneficial to move the definition of ``getCrs()`` and
``getCcs()`` to somewhere accessible by all specializations, require a
``getGlobalRowCopy()`` method to be defined for each specialization,
and then hook in to that method from within ``getCrs()`` and
``getCcs()``.

Currently, the MatrixAdapter specializations do not inherit from any
common class.  We could define a ``MatrixAdapterBase`` class, which
all MatrixAdapter's would inherit from, and which would define such
methods.

Along with the above, we also have the (potential) issue that some
Matrix types are more efficiently accessed by columns, rather than
rows, so that it would make sense to have the definitions of
``getCrs()`` and ``getCcs()`` "swapped".  That is, define ``getCrs()``
in terms of ``getCcs()``.

One way to take care of this would be to define two types::

  struct row_access {};

and::

  struct column_access {};

Then, we define two overloaded versions of some common worker
functions: ``do_getCrs()`` and ``do_getCcs()``.  For each, one
overloaded version accepts as a function parameter an object of type
``row_access``, and the other overloaded version takes as a parameter
an object of type ``column_access``.

The version of ``do_getCrs()`` that accepts a ``row_access`` object
defines the entirety of the method, while the ``do_getCcs()`` for
``row_access`` calls do_getCrs() and transposes the results.
Conversely for the ``column_access`` versions.

Here is a sample of what the setup might look like::

  template< typename Matrix >   // Of an Amesos::MatrixAdapter type
  struct MatrixAdapterBase {

    void do_getCrs(
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::scalar_type> nzval,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_ordinal_type> colind,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_size_type> rowptr,
      size_t& nnz,
      row_access type,
      bool local = false,
      int root = 0);

    void do_getCrs(
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::scalar_type> nzval,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_ordinal_type> colind,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_size_type> rowptr,
      size_t& nnz,
      column_access type,
      bool local = false,
      int root = 0);

    void do_getCcs(
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::scalar_type> nzval,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_ordinal_type> rowind,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_size_type> colptr,
      size_t& nnz,
      row_access type,
      bool local = false,
      int root = 0);

    void do_getCcs(
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::scalar_type> nzval,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_ordinal_type> rowind,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_size_type> colptr,
      size_t& nnz,
      column_access type,
      bool local = false,
      int root = 0);

    void getCrs(
      const Teuchos::ArrauView<typename Matrix::scalar_type> nzval,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_ordinal_type> rowind,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_size_type> colptr,
      size_t& nnz,
      bool local = false,
      int root = 0)
      {
	typedef typename Matrix::access_type mat_access_type;
	do_getCrs(nzval,rowind,colptr,nnz,mat_access_type,local,root);
      }

    void getCcs(
      const Teuchos::ArrauView<typename Matrix::scalar_type> nzval,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_ordinal_type> rowind,
      const Teuchos::ArrayView<typename Matrix::global_size_type> colptr,
      size_t& nnz,
      bool local = false,
      int root = 0)
      {
	typedef typename Matrix::access_type mat_access_type;
	do_getCcs(nzval,rowind,colptr,nnz,mat_access_type,local,root);
      }
  };

MatrixAdapter classes would publicly inherit from this base class::

  class MatrixAdapter< Epetra_RowMatrix >
    : public MatrixAdapterBase< MatrixAdapter< Epetra_RowMatrix > >
  {
    typedef row_access access_type;

    ...
  }

Which could also provide virtual definitions for methods which should
be defined in specializations (in order to double-check
implementation).

Using this convention, it would be easy to define MatrixAdapter
interfaces for MultiVector objects.  They would just need to define a
``getGlobalRowCopy()`` method and ``typedef column_access
access_type;``.


Adapters in General (DONE)
===================

It may be possible to define many of the more ``involved'' adapter
operations, e.g.::

  - MatrixAdapter<MAT>::getCrs()
  - MatrixAdapter<MAT>::getCcs()
  - MultiVecAdapter<MV>::localize()
  - MultiVecAdapter<MV>::globalize()

in terms of some of the less involved functions.  If we could pinpoint
what those functions are, we could break the more involved functions
out into an abstract base class and define them in terms of the
simpler functions that are easier to wrap.  In that way, a future
developer would not need to redefine getCrs() for every new sparse
matrix object; she would just need to wrap some of the more general
functions.

We would also ideally be able to do this without breaking much
existing code...

::

  struct has_special_impl {};
  struct no_special_impl {};

  class MatrixAdapter< Epetra_RowMatrix >
    : public MatrixAdapterBase< MatrixAdapter< Epetra_RowMatrix > >
  {
    typedef no_special_impl get_crs_spec;

    ...
  }

and in MatrixAdapterBase, an entry-point and two overloaded doers::

  getCrs(...){
    do_getCrs(..., adapter_type::get_crs_spec());
  }

  do_getCrs(..., no_special_impl nsi){
    // do the `template algorithm` stuff here
  }

  do_getCrs(..., has_special_impl hsi){
    // delegate to the specialized implementation found in the subclass
    static_cast<adapter_type*>(this)->getCrs_spec(...);
  }

  struct row_access {};     // as above
  struct column_access {};  // as above

To accomplish all this, it may be useful to define some templated
factories, or some nonmember constructors.


Organization
============

It may eventually be nice to organize the adapters into their own
directory structure, so that they do not entirely clutter up the main
src/ directory.  For that matter, it might be nice to put the solvers
themselves in their own directory.
