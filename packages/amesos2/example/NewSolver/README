 NewSolver Templates
=====================

The files in this directory should act as a template or example to
developers who would like to create an Amesos2 interface for a new
third-party library.

Workflow
========

1. Copy the files in this folder to the
$(TRILINOS_HOME)/packages/amesos2/src/ directory, replacing
"NewSolver" with the name of the TPL (from now on: "TPL").

2. Update Amesos2_TPL_TypeMap.hpp and Ameso2_TPL_FunctionMap.hpp with
partial template specializations for the data types supported by TPL.
Add or modify function calls in Ameso2_TPL_FunctionMap.hpp to reflect
the needs of TPL.

3. Modify Amesos2_TPL_MatrixHelpers.hpp to suite the needs of TPL.
Make use of the functions defined in Amesos2_TPL_FunctionMap.hpp.

4. Determine what private data members need to be defined in
Amesos::TPL to effectively interact with the TPL solver.

5. Define Amesos::TPL::setParameters_impl() so that it extracts
options from the Teuchos::ParameterList that should be supported by
this Amesos2 interface.

6. Use the functions defined in Amesos2_TPL_FunctionMap.hpp and
Amesos2_TPL_MatrixHelpers.hpp, while considering the options defined
in Amesos::TPL::setParameters_impl(), to fill in the the details of
  - Amesos::TPL::preOrdering_impl(),
  - Amesos::TPL::symbolicFactorization_impl(),
  - Amesos::TPL::numericFactorization_impl(), and
  - Amesos::TPL::solve_impl().

7. Modify Amesos2_Factory_decl.hpp to conditionally include
Amesos2_TPL.hpp and Amesos::Factory::create() in
Amesos2_Factory_def.hpp to return the proper solver interface
instance. 
  
8. Define UnitTests for TPL in amesos2/test/solvers/


Notes
=====

Matrix and vector adapters
--------------------------

The Amesos2 matrix and multi-vector adapters have been designed to
give functionality that would be fundamental for use with linear
solvers, not much more.  Please use them!

If there is some functionality that is not present in the adapters,
and you feel it would be most convenient for writing your Amesos2
solver interface, consider emailing the lead developer of Amesos2
about adding the functionality.

Implicit scalar-type conversion
-------------------------------

As of yet, Amesos2 does not by default support implicit type
conversion of the scalar type used in Matrix and MultiVector
arguments.  The only type conversions that will occur must be fully
defined in Amesos2_TPL_TypeMap.hpp and Amesos2_TPL_FunctionMap.hpp,
which could be a long-winded process.

For example, if a TPL only supports float scalar type, then in order
to support the conversion of integer scalar matrix entries to the
float type, there would need to be defined::

  TypeMap<TPL,int>
  {
    typedef float type;
    typedef float magnitude_type;
  }

and::

  FunctionMap<TPL,int>
  {
    /* converts int arguments to float before forwarding to TPL */
    static void solve( /* args */ ){ ... }
    
    /* etc. */
  }

Most conversions between the actual scalar type and the mapped type
would occur in a call to Teuchos::as<float>(int);
