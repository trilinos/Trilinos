Problems existing in Zoltan.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR CONDITIONS IN ZOLTAN
When a processor returns from Zoltan to the application due to an error
condition, other processors do not necessarily return the same condition.
In fact, other processors may not know that the processor has quit Zoltan,
and may hang in a communication (waiting for a message that is not sent 
due to the error condition).  The parallel error-handling capabilities of
Zoltan will be improved in future releases.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ERROR CONDITIONS IN OCTREE, PARMETIS AND JOSTLE
On failure, OCTREE, ParMETIS and Jostle methods abort rather than return 
error codes.  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ZOLTAN_INITIALIZE BUT NO ZOLTAN_FINALIZE
If Zoltan_Initialize calls MPI_Init, then MPI_Finalize
will never be called because there is no Zoltan_Finalize routine.
If the application uses MPI and calls MPI_Init and MPI_Finalize,
then there is no problem.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HETEROGENEOUS ENVIRONMENTS
Some parts of Zoltan currently assume that basic data types like 
integers and real numbers (floats) have identical representation
on all processors. This may not be true in a heterogeneous
environment. Specifically, the unstructured (irregular) communication
library is unsafe in a heterogeneous environment. This problem
will be corrected in a future release of Zoltan for heterogeneous
systems.

F90 ISSUES
Pacific Sierra Research (PSR) Vastf90 is not currently supported due to bugs 
in the compiler with no known workarounds. It is not known when or if this 
compiler will be supported. 

N.A.Software FortranPlus is not currently supported due to problems with the 
query functions. We anticipate that this problem can be overcome, and support 
will be added soon.

PROBLEMS EXISTING IN PARMETIS 
(Reported to the ParMETIS development team at the University of Minnesota,
 metis@cs.umn.edu)

Name: vsize array freed in ParMetis 
Version: ParMETIS 3.0 and 3.1
Symptom: seg. fault, core dump at runtime
Description:
  When calling ParMETIS_V3_AdaptiveRepart with the vsize parameter,
  ParMetis will try to free the vsize array even if it was
  allocated in Zoltan. Zoltan will then try to free vsize again
  later, resulting in a fatal error. As a temporary fix,
  Zoltan will never call ParMetis with the vsize parameter. 
Reported: 11/25/2003.
Status: Acknowledged by George Karypis.

Name: ParMETIS_V3_AdaptiveRepart and ParMETIS_V3_PartKWay crash 
      for zero-sized partitions.
Version: ParMETIS 3.1
Symptom: run-time error "killed by signal 8" on DEC.  FPE, divide-by-zero.
Description:
  Metis divides by partition size; thus, zero-sized partitions
  cause a floating-point exception. 
Reported: 9/9/2003.
Status: ?

Name: ParMETIS_V3_AdaptiveRepart dies for zero-sized partitions.
Version: ParMETIS 3.0
Symptom: run-time error "killed by signal 8" on DEC.  FPE, divide-by-zero.
Description:
   ParMETIS_V3_AdaptiveRepart divides by partition size; thus, zero-sized 
   partitions cause a floating-point exception.  This problem is exhibited in 
   adaptive-partlocal3 tests.  The tests actually run on Sun and Linux machines 
   (which don't seem to care about the divide-by-zero), but cause an FPE 
   signal on DEC (Compaq) machines.
Reported: 1/23/2003.
Status: Fixed in ParMetis 3.1, but new problem appeared (see above).

Name: ParMETIS_V3_AdaptiveRepart crashes when no edges.
Version: ParMETIS 3.0
Symptom: Floating point exception, divide-by-zero.
Description:
   Divide-by-zero in ParMETISLib/adrivers.c, function Adaptive_Partition, 
   line 40.
Reported: 1/23/2003.
Status: Fixed in ParMetis 3.1.

Name: Uninitialized memory read in akwayfm.c.
Version: ParMETIS 3.0
Symptom: UMR warning.
Description:
   UMR in ParMETISLib/akwayfm.c, function Moc_KWayAdaptiveRefine, near line 520.
Reported: 1/23/2003.
Status: Fixed in ParMetis 3.1.

Name: Memory leak in wave.c
Version: ParMETIS 3.0
Symptom: Some memory not freed.
Description:
   Memory leak in ParMETISLib/wave.c, function WavefrontDiffusion;
   memory for the following variables is not always freed:
   solution, perm, workspace, cand
   We believe the early return near line 111 causes the problem.
Reported: 1/23/2003.
Status: Fixed in ParMetis 3.1.

Name: tpwgts ignored for small graphs.
Version: ParMETIS 3.0
Symptom: incorrect output (partitioning)
Description:
   When using ParMETIS_V3_PartKway to partition into partitions
   of unequal sizes, the input array tpwgts is ignored and
   uniform-sized partitions are computed. This bug shows up when
   (a) the number of vertices is < 10000 and (b) only one weight
   per vertex is given (ncon=1).
Reported: Reported to George Karypis and metis@cs.umn.edu on 2002/10/30.
Status: Fixed in ParMetis 3.1.


Name: AdaptiveRepart crashes on partless test.
Version: ParMETIS 3.0
Symptom: run-time segmentation violation. 
Description:
   ParMETIS_V3_AdaptiveRepart crashes with a SIGSEGV if
   the input array _part_ contains any value greater then
   the desired number of partitions, nparts. This shows up
   in Zoltan's "partless" test cases. 
Reported: Reported to George Karypis and metis@cs.umn.edu on 2002/12/02.
Status: Fixed in ParMetis 3.1.


Name: load imbalance tolerance
Version: ParMETIS 2.0
Symptom: missing feature
Description:
   The load imbalance parameter UNBALANCE_FRACTION can
   only be set at compile-time. With Zoltan it is
   necessary to be able to set this parameter at run-time.
Reported: Reported to metis@cs.umn.edu on 19 Aug 1999.
Status: Fixed in version 3.0.


Name: no edges
Version: ParMETIS 2.0
Symptom: segmentation fault at run time
Description:
   ParMETIS crashes if the input graph has no edges and
   ParMETIS_PartKway is called. We suspect all the graph based
   methods crash. From the documentation it is unclear if
   a NULL pointer is a valid input for the adjncy array.
   Apparently, the bug occurs both with NULL as input or
   a valid pointer to an array.
Reported: Reported to metis@cs.umn.edu on 5 Oct 1999.
Status: Fixed in version 3.0.


Name: no vertices
Version: ParMETIS 2.0, 3.0, 3.1
Symptom: segmentation fault at run time
Description:
   ParMETIS may crash if a processor owns no vertices.
   The extent of this bug is not known (which methods are affected).
   Again, it is unclear if NULL pointers are valid input.
Reported: Reported to metis@cs.umn.edu on 6 Oct 1999.
Status: Fixed in 3.0 and 3.1 for the graph methods, but not the geometric methods.
        New bug report sent on 2003/08/20.


Name: partgeom bug
Version: ParMETIS 2.0
Symptom: floating point exception
Description:
   For domains where the global delta_x, delta_y, or delta_z (in 3D)
   is zero (e.g., all nodes lie along the y-axis), a floating point
   exception can occur when the partgeom algorithm is used.
Reported: kirk@cs.umn.edu in Jan 2001.
Status: Fixed in version 3.0.
