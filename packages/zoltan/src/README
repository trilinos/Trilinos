QUICK INSTALLATION

In order to build Zoltan, you must do the following steps:

1) Go to Utilities/Config and find a configuration file Config.<platform>
   that is similar to your platform, for example, gcc, solaris, dec, or tflop.
   Edit the paths as appropriate for your system. Zoltan can be
   configured with several optional third-party libraries,
   like ParMetis. Simply comment out PARMETIS_LIBPATH if you don't 
   have or need ParMetis, for example. Use Config.generic if you 
   can't find anything better, or if you prefer a minimal installation. 

2) Go back to the Zoltan root directory and type

      gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH=<platform> zoltan

   where <platform> is your platform. You may simply type "gmake zoltan" 
   if you are using the generic platform.

3) The Zoltan library is now located in Zoltan/Obj_<platform> as libzoltan.a.
   You will also need the libraries libzoltan_comm.a and libzoltan_mem.a.

It is strongly recommended that you read the more detailed installation 
instructions in the Zoltan User's Guide, which can be found at
Zoltan/docs/Zoltan_html/ug_html/ug.html (HTML) or at
Zoltan/docs/Zoltan_pdf/ug.pdf (pdf).

                   load-balancing data structure definitions, interface
                   functions, and functions related to the load-balancing
                   interface and migration-help tools.

OTHER CODE (not compiled into the Zoltan library)
-------------------------------------------------

driver          -- Driver programs zdrive and zCPPdrive that read exodus/nemesis 
                   files, run Zoltan and then write out the new assignment vectors.
                   These programs are compiled by making zdrive or zCPPdrive target.

ch              -- Routines developed by Hendrickson and Leland to read Chaco
                   input files and build graphs in the zdrive program.

examples        -- A directory containing very simple C and C++ applications 

fdriver         -- Fortran version of driver, primarily used for testing
                   the Fortran interface.

ZoltanComponent -- A CCA wrapper around the zoltan library. making it a 
		   CCA component of the classic kind.

OTHER DIRECTORIES
-----------------

test		-- Test problems in both Nemesis/Exodus and Chaco formats.
                   Also contains the script test_zoltan that runs the test 
                   driver with all the test problems.

util		-- Utility scripts and a graphical partition viewer vtk_view
