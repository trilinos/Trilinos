/* Routine to print the SFC generated by the octree partitioning.
 * Currently, this routine works only for 2D problems.
 * Extension to 3D is straightforward, but harder to plot.
 *
 * This routine is SERIAL and, thus, does not scale with the number 
 * of processors.
 *
 * Three types of output are produced by this one routine.
 *
 * Region information:  For each region, its coordinates are printed, 
 * along with the processor number of the processor storing the region.
 * To create a curve through the regions, 
 * -  redirect output of zdrive to file
 * -  grep PLOTREG file > file.r
 * -  Edit file.r so that processor's blocks of regions are in increasing
 *    order (i.e., all processor zero's regions, then all processor one's, etc.
 *    If the architecture handles Print_Sync correctly, this step should not
 *    be needed.
 * -  Edit file.r to remove PLOTREG from each line; in vi: %s/PLOTREG//g
 * -  gnuplot: plot "file.r" using 2:3 with linespoints
 *
 *
 * SFC through octants:  For each leaf octant, its midpoint is printed, along
 * with the processor number of the processor storing the octant. 
 * NOTE:  the curve through the octants is what is used for partitioning!
 * To create a curve through the octants, 
 * -  redirect output of zdrive to file
 * -  grep PLOTOCT file > file.o
 * -  Edit file.o so that processor's blocks of octants are in increasing
 *    order (i.e., all processor zero's octants, then all processor one's, etc.
 *    If the architecture handles Print_Sync correctly, this step should not
 *    be needed.
 * -  Edit file.o to remove PLOTOCT from each line; in vi: %s/PLOTOCT//g
 * -  gnuplot: plot "file.o" using 2:3 with linespoints
 *
 *
 * The resulting octree:  For each leaf octant, its bounding box is written
 * to file "octants.gnu".  Writing to the file must be done serially.
 * To plot the octree:
 * - gnuplot: plot "octants.gnu" with lines
