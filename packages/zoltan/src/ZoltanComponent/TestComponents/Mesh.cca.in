# generated CCAFFEINE dynamic library index.
# The ! lines should not contain whitespace before the =
# unless they begin with something other than date,builder,location.
# There may be more than 1 library in a .cca file, in which case
# last ! meta data seen wins for following library and component info.
# Note that if you want to change the user's "apparent" class name
# seen in the UI, you can change the name following the constructor function
# name in this file.
# N.B.:
# This is the exceedingly-poor-mans version of some of the info
# we'd want from a repository. We'd also want a list of ports
# that must be known (dependencies), a list of ports provided or
# at least potentially provided, parallel fabric expectations,
# version knowledge, and the usual ton of other metadata.
#  Finally, we'd like to get all this info directly from the
# library itself (perhaps by filtering the source or by running
# 'strings' over the libraries.
