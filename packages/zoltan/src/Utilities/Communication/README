COMM DIRECTORY -- Package to efficiently perform unstructured communication
		  operations.  The same pattern can be created once and
		  used repeatedly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

comm_const.h   -- Comm_Obj data structure definition and prototypes for 
                  communication package functions.

comm_main.c    -- Main routine to test the communication library.

comm_create.c  -- Routine to create communication object.  

comm_destroy.c -- Free the space allocated for a communication object.

comm_resize.c  -- This routine allows the user to describe variable sizes
		  for the objects to be communicated.

comm_exchange_sizes.c -- When objects are being resized, this updates the
		  receiving processors' knowledge of message sizes.

comm_do.c      -- Routine that uses communication object to actually perform
		  unstructured communication.

comm_do_reverse.c -- This routine performs the inverse communication of the
		  operation described in a communication object.

comm_invert_map.c -- Given a set of messages to send, determine the
		  corresponding set of recieves for each processor
		  (or vice versa).

comm_sort_ints.c -- Version of quicksort which is used in comm routines.
