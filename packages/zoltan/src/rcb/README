RCB DIRECTORY -- Implementation of Recursive Coordinate Bisection.  Also
                 includes Recursive Inertial Bisection due to the similarity
                 of the algorithms.

rcb_const.h   -- Data structure definitions needed for RCB (RCB_Struct,
                 rcb_box, rcb_median, rcb_tree).  Prototypes for
                 external functions in rcb_util.c.

rcb.c         -- Implementation of RCB.

                 build the data structures needed for RCB algorithm.

point_assign.c -- Given a geometric decomposition constructed via RCB or RIB,
		 this routine determines which processor a particular
		 geometric point is assigned to.

box_assign.c  -- Given a geometric decomposition constructed via RCB or RIB,
		 this routine determines which processors an axis-aligned
		 box intersects.

create_proc_list.c -- Create the communication list to communicate dots
                      between processors in each half at each step of
