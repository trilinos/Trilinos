Some simple C examples may be found in the "C" directory, and
C++ examples in the "CPP" directory.  

Both sets of examples are built with the Makefile found in
this directory, with the command:

gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH={arch} all

"arch" is the same name you used to specify your build
configuration when you built the Zoltan library.

You can build just the C examples with:

gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH={arch} C_Examples

Or just the C++ examples with:

gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH={arch} CPP_Examples

Note that C++ implementations vary widely.  If you have trouble
building the CPP examples, try defining or not defining
the MPI_CPP or NAMESPACES_OK values in the tests' source files.

To run an example, launch it on any number of processes as you would 
any MPI application:

mpirun -np 4 zoltanSimple
