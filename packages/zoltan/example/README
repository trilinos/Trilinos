Some simple C examples may be found in the "C" directory, and
C++ examples in the "CPP" directory.  Edit the classicMakefile found
in those directories to build the examples.

Note that C++ implementations vary widely.  If you have trouble
building the CPP examples, try defining or not defining
the MPI_CPP or NAMESPACES_OK values in the tests' source files.

To run an example, launch it on any number of processes as you would 
any MPI application:

mpirun -np 4 simpleRCB
