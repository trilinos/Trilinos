Zoltan release notes for Trilinos v12.8

Improved robustness of RCB partitioner for problems where many objects have
weight = 0 (e.g., PIC codes).  Convergence is faster and the stopping 
criteria are more robust.

Fixed bug that occurred when RETURN_LIST=PARTS and (Num_GID > 1 or Num_LID > 1);
GIDs and LIDs are now copied correctly into return lists.

Fixed a bug related to struct padding in the siMPI serial MPI interface.

Zoltan release notes for Trilinos v11.

Highlights are listed below; for more details, see 
Trilinos/packages/zoltan/doc/Zoltan_html/ug_html/ug_release.html .

-  Zoltan is now released under Trilinos' BSD license.

-  The following Zoltan features are no longer supported in Trilinos v11:
   +  Zoltan v1 interface (as described in Zoltan include file lbi_const.h)
   +  Partitioning method OCTPART: use partitioning method HSFC instead.


-  Hierarchical partitioning received several performance, interface and 
   testing improvements.  An easier-to-use interface has been 
   added using simple parameters (HIER_ASSIST, PLATFORM_NAME, TOPOLOGY)
   instead of callback functions; the callback function interface is still
   supported. 

-  Memory usage in Zoltan Distributed Data Directories is improved, leading to
   faster execution times for data directories and hierarchical partitioning.

-  Compilation with gcc 4.7 is now supported.

-  Zoltan supports PT-Scotch v5.1.12 and ParMETIS v4, as well as some older
   versions of these TPLs.
