<H2>
<A NAME="fortran ug 77"></A>FORTRAN 77</H2>
There is no FORTRAN 77 interface for Zoltan; however, an existing FORTRAN
77 application can be compiled by a Fortran 90 compiler provided it does
not use vendor specific extensions (unless the same extensions are supported
by the Fortran 90 compiler), and the application can use Zoltan's Fortran
90 interface with a minimal amount of Fortran 90 additions. This section
provides details of the Fortran 90 code that must be added.

<P>When building the Zoltan library, use the file 
<I>fort/zoltan_user_data.f90</I> for <I>zoltan_user_data.f90</I>.
This assumes that DATA in a
call to <B><A HREF="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Set_Fn">ZOLTAN_SET_FN</A></B>
is either omitted (you can omit arguments that are labeled OPTIONAL in
the Fortran API) or an array of type INTEGER, REAL or DOUBLE PRECISION
(REAL*4 and REAL*8 might be acceptable). If a more complicated set of data
is required (for example, two arrays), then it should be made available
to the query functions through COMMON blocks.

<P>To get access to the interface, each program unit (main program, subroutine
or function) that calls a Zoltan routine must begin with the statement
<UL>USE ZOLTAN</UL>
and this should be the first statement after the program, subroutine or
function statement (before the declarations).

<P>The pointer to the Zoltan structure returned by <B><A HREF="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Create">ZOLTAN_CREATE</A></B>
should be declared as
<UL>TYPE(ZOLTAN_STRUCT), POINTER :: ZZ</UL>
(you can use a name other than ZZ if you wish).

<P>To create the structure, use a pointer assignment statement with the call
to <B><A HREF="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Create">ZOLTAN_CREATE</A></B>:
<UL>ZZ => <B><A HREF="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Create">ZOLTAN_CREATE</A></B>(COMMUNICATOR)</UL>
Note that the assignment operator is "=>".
If ZZ is used in more than one procedure, then put it in a COMMON block.
It cannot be passed as an argument unless the procedure interfaces are
made "explicit." (Let's not go there.)

<P>The eight import and export arrays passed to <B><A HREF="ug_interface_lb.html#Zoltan_LB_Partition">ZOLTAN_LB_PARTITION</A></B>
(and other procedures) must be pointers. They should be declared as, for
example,
<UL>INTEGER, POINTER :: IMPORT_GLOBAL_IDS(:)</UL>
Note that the double colon after POINTER is required, and the dimension
must be declared as "(:)" with a colon.
Like ZZ, if they are used in more than one procedure, pass them through
a COMMON block, not as an argument.

<P>Except in the unlikely event that the default kinds of intrinsic types
do not match the C intrinsic types, you do not have to use the kind type
parameters <B>Zoltan_INT</B>, etc. It is also not necessary to include the
INTENT attribute in the declarations of the query functions, so they can
be simplified to, for example,
<UL>SUBROUTINE GET_OBJ_LIST(DATA, GLOBAL_IDS, LOCAL_IDS, WGT_DIM, OBJ_WGTS,
IERR)
<BR>INTEGER DATA(*),GLOBAL_IDS(*),LOCAL_IDS(*),WGT_DIM,IERR
<BR>REAL OBJ_WGTS(*)</UL>
to be more consistent with a FORTRAN 77 style.
