<A NAME="fortran ug sys mpich"></A>MPICH</H3>
As of version 1.1.2, the MPICH implementation of MPI is not completely
"Fortran 90 friendly." Only one problem was encountered during our tests:&nbsp;
the reliance on command line arguments. MPICH uses command line arguments
during the start-up process, even if the application does not. Command
line arguments are not standard in Fortran, so although most compilers
offer it as an extension, each compiler has its own method of handling
them. The problem arises when one Fortran compiler is specified during
the build of MPICH and another Fortran compiler is used for the application.
This should not be a problem on systems where there is only one Fortran
compiler, or where multiple Fortran compilers are compatible (for example,
FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90 compilers from the same vendor). If your program
can get past the call to MPI_Init, then you do not have this problem.

<P>To solve this problem, build MPICH in such a way that it does not include
the routines for <I>iargc</I> and <I>getarg</I> (I have been able to do
this by using the -f95nag flag when configuring MPICH), and then provide
your own versions of them when you link the application. Some versions
of these routines are provided in <I>fdriver/farg_*</I>.
<H3>
<A NAME="fortran ug sys pacific"></A>Pacific Sierra</H3>
Pacific Sierra Research (PSR) Vastf90 is not currently supported due to
bugs in the compiler with no known workarounds. It is not known when or
if this compiler will be supported.

<H3>
<A NAME="fortran ug sys NAS"></A>NASoftware</H3>
N.A.Software FortranPlus is not currently supported due to problems with
the query functions. We anticipate that this problem can be overcome, and
support will be added soon.
