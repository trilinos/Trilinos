<H2>
<A NAME="REFTREE"></A>Refinement Tree Partitioning (REFTREE)</H2>
The refinement tree based partitioning method is due to William Mitchell
of the National Institute of Standards and Technology
[<A HREF="ug_refs.html#reftree">Mitchell</A>].
It is closely related to the Octree and Space-Filling Curve methods,
except it uses the tree that represents the adaptive refinement process
that created the grid.  This tree is constructed through the tree-based
query functions.

<P>Each node of the refinement tree corresponds to an element that
occurred during the grid refinement process.  The first level of the tree
(the children of the root of the tree) corresponds to the initial coarse
grid, one tree node per initial element.  It is assumed that the initial
coarse grid does not change through the execution of the program, except
that the local IDs, assignment of elements to processors, and weights
can change.  If any other aspect of the coarse grid changes, then the
Zoltan structure should be destroyed and recreated.
The children of a node in the
tree correspond to the elements that were created when the corresponding
element was refined.  The children are ordered such that a traversal of
the tree creates a space-filling curve within each initial element.
If the initial elements can be ordered with a contiguous path through them,
then the traversal creates a space-filling curve through all the elements.
Each element has a designated "in" vertex and "out" vertex, with the out
vertex of one element being the same as the in vertex of the next element
in the path, in other words the path goes through a vertex to move from
one element to the next (and does not go out the same vertex it came in).

<P>The user may allow Zoltan to determine the order of the coarse grid
elements, or may specify the order, which might be faster or produce a
better path.  If Zoltan determines the order, the user can select between
an order that will produce connected partitions, an order based on a Hilbert
Space Filling Curve, or an order based on a Sierpinski Space Filling Curve.
See the parameter REFTREE_INITPATH below.  If the user provides the order, then
the in/out vertices must also be supplied.  Similarly, the
user may specify the order and in/out vertices of the child elements, or
allow Zoltan to determine them.  If the user knows how to provide a good
ordering for the children, this may be significantly faster than the default
general algorithm.  However, accelerated forms of the ordering algorithm
are provided for certain types of refinement schemes and should be used in
those cases.
See <B><A HREF="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_CHILD_LIST_FN">ZOLTAN_CHILD_LIST_FN</A></B>.
If the user always specifies the order, then the vertices and in/out vertices
are not used and do not have to be provided.

<P>Weights are assigned to the nodes of the tree.  These weights need not be
only on the leaves (the elements of the final grid), but can also be on
interior nodes (for example, to represent work on coarse grids of a multigrid
algorithm).  The default weights are 1.0 at the leaves and 0.0 at the
interior nodes, which produces a partition based on the number of elements
in each partition.
An initial tree traversal is used to sum the weights, and a second traversal
to cut the space-filling curve into appropriately-sized pieces and assign
elements to partitions.  The number of partitions is not necessarily equal
to the number of processors.

<P> The following limitations should be removed in the future.
<LI>For multicomponent weights, only the first component is used.
<LI>Heterogeneous architectures are not supported, in the sense that the
computational load is equally divided over the processors.  A vector of
relative partition sizes is used to determine the weight assigned to each
partition, but they are currently all equal.  In the future they should
be input to reflect heterogeneity.

<TD>
Determines the method for finding an order of the elements in the initial
grid. </BR>
"SIERPINSKI" uses a Sierpinski Space Filling Curve and is most appropriate
for grids consisting of triangles.  It is currently limited to 2D. </BR>
"HILBERT" uses a Hilbert Space Filling Curve and is most appropriate for grids
consisting of quadralaterals or hexahedra. </BR>
"CONNECTED" attempts to produce connected partitions (guaranteed for triangles
and tetrahedra), however they tend to be stringy, i.e., less compact than the
SFC methods.  It is most appropriate when connected partitions are required. </BR>
An invalid character string will invoke the default method.
