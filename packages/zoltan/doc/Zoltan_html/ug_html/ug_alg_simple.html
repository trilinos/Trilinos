<h2>
<a name="SIMPLE"></a>Simple Partitioners for Testing</h2>

Zoltan includes two very simple partitioners for testing initial 
implementations of Zoltan in applications.  These partitioners are
intended only for testing and to serve as examples.
They use neither geometry nor connectivity (graph/hypergraph), so they 
require very few query functions (only two!).
