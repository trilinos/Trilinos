<h2>
<a NAME="Graph"></a>Graph partitioning</h2>

<p>Zoltan performs graph partitioning when the <i>LB_METHOD</i>
parameter is set to GRAPH.
Zoltan provides three packages capable of partitioning a graph.  The
package is chosen by setting the GRAPH_PACKAGE parameter.  
Two packages (ParMetis and Scotch) are external packages and not
part of Zoltan but accessible via Zoltan. The last package is
PHG, Zoltan's native hypergraph partitioner. PHG will treat
the graph as a regular hypergraph with edge size two. 
Since PHG was designed for general hypergraphs, it is usually
slower than graph partitioners but often produces better quality.
