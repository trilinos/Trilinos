<a NAME="Motivation"></a><hr><h2>Project Motivation</h2>

Over the past decade, parallel computers have been used with great success in
many scientific simulations. While differing in their numerical methods and
details of implementation, most applications successfully parallelized to date
are "static" applications.  Their data structures and memory usage do not
change during the course of the computation.  Their inter-processor
communication patterns are predictable and non-varying.  And their processor
workloads are predictable and roughly constant throughout the simulation.
Traditional finite difference and finite element methods are examples of
widely used static applications.
<p>
However, increasing use of "dynamic" simulation techniques is creating new
challenges for developers of parallel software. For example, adaptive finite
element methods refine localized regions the mesh and/or adjust the order of
the approximation on individual elements to obtain a desired accuracy in the
numerical solution.   As a result, memory must be allocated dynamically to
allow creation of new elements or degrees of freedom.  Communication patterns
can vary as refinement creates new element neighbors.  And localized
refinement can cause severe processor load imbalance as elemental and
processor work loads change throughout a simulation.
<p>
Particle simulations and crash simulations are other examples of dynamic
applications.  In particle simulations, scalable parallel performance depends
upon a good assignment of particles to processors; grouping physically close
particles within a single processor reduces inter-processor communication.
Similarly, in crash simulations, assignment of physically close surfaces to a
single processor enables efficient parallel contact search.  In both cases,
data structures and communication patterns change as particles and surfaces
move.  Re-partitioning of the particles or surfaces is needed to maintain
geometric locality of objects within processors.
<p>
We developed the Zoltan library to simplilfy many of the difficulties
arising in dynamic applications.  Zoltan is a collection of data management
services for unstructured, adaptive and dynamic applications.
It includes a
suite of parallel partitioning algorithms, data migration tools, distributed
data directories, unstructured communication services, and dynamic memory
management tools.  Zoltan's data-structure neutral design allows it to be used
by a variety of applications without imposing restrictions on application data
structures.  Its object-based interface provides a simple and inexpensive way
for application developers to use the library and researchers to make new
capabilities available under a common interface.  
<p>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a NAME="Tools"></a><hr><h2>The Zoltan Toolkit</h2>
The Zoltan Library contains a number of tools that simplify the development
and improve the performance of parallel, unstructured and adaptive
applications.  The library is organized as a toolkit, so that application
developers can use as little or as much of the library as desired.  The major
packages in Zoltan are listed below.
<ul>
<li>
A suite of <a href="ug_alg.html">dynamic load balancing and parallel repartitioning</a> algorithms;
switching between algorithms is easy, allowing straightforward comparisons of
algorithms in applications.
</li>
<li>
<a href="ug_interface_mig.html">Data migration tools</a> for moving data from
old partitions to new one.
</li>
<li>
<a href="../dev_html/dev_util_dd.html">Distributed data directories</a>:
scalable (in memory and computation) algorithms for locating needed
off-processor data.
</li>
<li>
An <a href="../dev_html/dev_util_comm.html">unstructured communication 
package</a> that insulates users from the details of message sends and
receives.
</li>
<li>
<a href="../dev_html/dev_util_mem.html">Dynamic memory management tools</a>
that greatly simplify dynamic memory debugging on state-of-the-art parallel
computers.
</li>

<li>
A sample application <a href="../dev_html/dev_driver.html"><i>zdrive</i></a>.
It allows algorithm developers 
to test changes to Zoltan without having to run Zoltan in 
a large application code.  Application developers can use the <i>zdrive</i>
code to see examples of function calls to Zoltan and the implementation of 
query functions.
</li>
</ul>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a NAME="Terms"></a><hr><h2>Terminology</h2>

Our design of Zoltan does not restrict it to any particular type of
application.  Rather, Zoltan operates on uniquely identifiable data items that
we can <i>objects</i>.  For example, in finite element applications, objects
might be elements or nodes of the mesh.  In particle applications, objects
might be particles.  In linear solvers, objects might be matrix rows.
<p>
Each object must have a unique <i>global identifier (ID)</i> 
represented as an array
of unsigned integers.  Common choices include global numbers of elements
(nodes, particles, rows, and so on) that already exist in many applications,
or a structure consisting of an owning processor number and the object's
local-memory index.  Objects might also have local (to a processor) IDs that
do not have to be unique globally.  Local IDs such as addresses or local-array
indices of objects can improve the performance (and convenience) of Zoltan's
interface to applications.
<p>
We use a simple example to illustrate the above terminology.
In the figure 
<a href="#Terms Figure">below</a>, a simple finite element mesh is presented.
<p>
<center><a NAME="Terms Figure"></a><img SRC="figures/Z.gif"></center>
<p>
The blue and yellow shading indicates the mesh is partitioned for two
processors.  An application must
provide information about the current mesh and partition to Zoltan.  
If, for example,
the application wants Zoltan to perform operations on the elements of the
mesh,
it must provide information about the elements when Zoltan asks for object 
information.
<p>
In this example, the elements have unique numbers
assigned to them, as shown by the numbers in the elements.  These unique
numbers can be used as global IDs in Zoltan.  In addition, on each
processor, local numbering information may be available.
For instance, the elements owned by a processor may be stored in arrays
in the processor's memory.  An element's local array index may be provided to Zoltan
as a local ID.
<p>
For geometric algorithms, the application must provide coordinate
information to Zoltan.  In this example, the coordinates of the mid-point of 
an element are used.
<p>
For graph-based algorithms, information about the connectivity of
the objects must be provided to Zoltan.  In this example, the application may
consider elements connected if they share a face.  The connections between
elements, or <i>edges</i> of the connectivity graph, are shown in red.
Connectivity information is passed to Zoltan by specifying a neighbor list for
an object.  The neighbor list consists of the global IDs of neighboring objects
and the processor(s) currently owning those objects.
<p>
The table below summarizes the information provided to Zoltan by an
application for this finite element mesh.  Information about the objects
includes their global and local IDs, geometry data, and graph data.

<a NAME="Design"></a><hr><h2>Zoltan Design</h2>
To make Zoltan easy to use, we do not impose any particular data structure on
an application, nor do we require an application to build a particular data
structure for Zoltan.  Instead, Zoltan uses a 
<a href="ug_query.html">callback function interface</a>, in
which Zoltan queries the application for needed data.  The application must
provide simple functions that answer these queries.
<p>
To keep the application interface simple, we use a small set of 
<a href="ug_query.html">callback functions</a>
and make them easy to write by requesting only information that is
easily accessible to applications.  For example, the most basic partitioning 
algorithms
require only four callback functions.  These functions return the number of
objects owned by a processor, a list of weights and IDs for owned objects, the
problem's dimensionality, and a given object's coordinates.  More
sophisticated graph-based partitioning algorithms require only two additional
callback functions, which return the number of edges per object and edge lists
for objects.
