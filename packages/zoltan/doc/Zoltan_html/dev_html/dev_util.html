<h2>
<a NAME="Utilities"></a>Utilities</h2>
Within Zoltan, several utilities are provided to simplify development of new algorithms
in the library.&nbsp; These packages provide functionality that is useful within both
Zoltan and applications in general.&nbsp; They are separate from the Zoltan library so
that applications can use them independently of Zoltan.&nbsp; They are compiled separately 
from Zoltan and are archived in separate libraries.&nbsp; Instructions for
<a href="#Building Utilities">building the utilities</a>
and <a href="#Building Applications">applications</a> using them
are included below; individual library names are listed in the following documentation for each 
package.&nbsp; Use of these utilities makes debugging in Zoltan easier
and provides a uniform look to the algorithms in the library.&nbsp; The
packages available are listed below.
<blockquote><a href="dev_util_mem.html">Memory Management Utilities</a>
<br><a href="dev_util_comm.html">Unstructured Communication Utilities</a>
<br><a href="dev_util_dd.html">Distributed Directory Utility</a>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<a NAME="Building Utilities"></a>Building Utilities</h2>
The utilities provided with Zoltan have their own Makefiles and can
be built separately from Zoltan.&nbsp; If the user 
<a href="../ug_html/ug_usage.html#Building the Library">builds the Zoltan library</a>, 
the utility libraries will be 
built automatically and copied to the appropriate <i>Zoltan/Obj_&lt;platform&gt;</i>
directory, where &lt;<i>platform</i>&gt; is specified through the 
<a href="../ug_html/ug_usage.html#Building the Library">ZOLTAN_ARCH environment variable</a>.&nbsp; 
Zoltan and the utilities share the 
<a href="../ug_html/ug_usage.html#Building the Library"><i>Utilities/Config/Config.&lt;platform&gt;</i></a>
files specifying compilation paths for
various architectures.&nbsp;
If, however, a user wishes to use these
utilities without using Zoltan, he must build the libraries 
separately.&nbsp;
<p>

The structure and use of Makefiles for the utilities are similar
to <a href="dev_dist_compile.html">Zoltan's makefiles</a>; 
a top-level makefile includes rules for building each utility's 
library.&nbsp; Object files and the utility libraries are stored in
a subdirectory <i>Obj_&lt;platform&gt;</i>, where &lt;<i>platform</i>&gt; is 
a target architecture  supported with a 
<i><a href="../ug_html/ug_usage.html#Building the Library">Utilities/Config/Config.&lt;platform&gt;</i></a>
file.&nbsp; The command for compiling a particular utility follows:
<blockquote>
gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH=&lt;<i>platform</i>&gt; &lt;<i>library_name</i>&gt;
</blockquote>
where &lt;<i>library_name</i>&gt; is the name of the utility library, and
&lt;<i>platform</i>&gt; is the target architecture (corresponding to 
<i>Utilities/Config/Config.&lt;platform&gt;</i>).&nbsp;
The &lt;<i>library_name</i>&gt; for each utility is included in the following documentation
for the utilities.&nbsp;
<p>

<h2>
<a NAME="Building Applications"></a>Building Applications</h2>
The utilities are designed so that they can easily be used separately 
from Zoltan in applications.&nbsp;  
To enable type-checking of arguments, the 
function-prototypes file for a utility should be included
in all application source code files that directly access the utility.&nbsp; 
The application must also link with the
appropriate utility library (and any other libraries on which
the utility depends).&nbsp; Library and function-prototype file names
for each utility are listed in the following documentation for the
utilities.&nbsp;
