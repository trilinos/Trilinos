<A NAME="intro"></A>Introduction and General Principles</H2>
The goal of the Zoltan project is to design a general-purpose tool for
parallel data management for unstructured, dynamic applications.&nbsp; This tool includes a suite of load-balancing
algorithms, an unstructured communication package, distributed data directories, and dynamic debugging tools that can be  used by a variety of applications.&nbsp; It will, thus,
be used by many application developers and be added to by many algorithm
developers.&nbsp; Software projects of this scale need general guidelines
and principles so that the code produced is easily maintained and added
to.&nbsp; We have tried to keep restrictions on developers to a minimum.&nbsp;
However, we do require that a few coding practices be followed.&nbsp; These
guidelines are described in the following sections:
