Within Zoltan, several services are provided to simplify development of new algorithms
in the library.&nbsp; Each service consists of a routine or set of routines that is 
compiled directly into Zoltan.&nbsp; Use of these services makes debugging easier
and provides a uniform look to the algorithms in the library.&nbsp; The
services available are listed below.
