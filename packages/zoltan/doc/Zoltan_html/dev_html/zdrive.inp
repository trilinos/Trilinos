# Decomposition Method = <method>
#
# This line is used to specify the algorithm that Zoltan will use
# for load balancing. Currently, the following methods that are acceptable:
#	rcb - Reverse Coordinate Bisection
#	octpart - Octree/Space Filling Curve
#	parmetis - ParMETIS graph partitioning
#	jostle - Jostle graph partitioning
#	reftree - Refinement tree partitioning
#	
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Decomposition Method	= rcb

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Zoltan Parameters = <options>
#
# This line is OPTIONAL. If it is not included, no user-defined parameters
# will be passed to Zoltan.
#
# This line is used to to specify parameter values to overwrite the default
# parameter values used in Zoltan.  These parameters will be passed to Zoltan
# through calls to Zoltan_Set_Param(). Parameters are set by entries consisting
# of pairs of strings "<parameter string>=<value string>". 
# The <parameter string> should be a string that is recognized by the
# particular load-balancing method being used.
# The parameter entries should be separated by commas. 
# When many parameters must be specified, multiple
# "Zoltan Parameters" lines may be included in the input file.
# NOTE:  The Fortran90 driver zfdrive can read only one parameter per line.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zoltan Parameters	= DEBUG_LEVEL=3
Zoltan Parameters	= RCB_REUSE=0

# File Type = <file type><,chaco options>
#
# This line is OPTIONAL. If it is not included, then it is assumed that
# the file type is parallel nemesis.
#
# This line contains tells which format the file is in. The current
# file types for this line are:
#	NemesisI	- parallel ExodusII/NemesisI files (1 per processor)
#	Chaco		- Chaco graph and/or geometry file(s)
#
# For NemesisI input, the initial distribution of data is given in the 
# Nemesis files.  For Chaco input, however, an initial decomposition is
# imposed by the zdrive.  Two initial distribution methods are provided.
# The method to be used can be specified in the chaco options:
#       initial distribution = <option>
# where <option> is
#       linear  -- gives the first n/p objects to proc 0, the
#                  next n/p objects to proc 1, etc.  
#       cyclic  -- assigns the objects to processors as one would
#                  deal cards; i.e., gives the first object to proc 0, 
#                  the second object to proc 1, ..., the pth object to 
#                  proc (p-1),the (p+1)th object to proc 0, the (p+2)th 
#                  object to proc 1, etc.
#       file    -- reads an initial distribution from the input file
#                  <filename>.assign, where File Name is specified by
#                  the "File Name" command line below.
#       owner   -- for vertices, same as "linear."  For hyperedge, send a 
#                  copy of a hyperedge to each processor owning one of its
#                  vertices.  (Multiple processors may then store each
#                  hyperedge.)
# If an initial distribution is not specified, the default is linear.
#
# A second Chaco option is to distribute the objects over a subset
# of the processors, not all processors. The syntax for this is:
#       initial procs = k
# where k is an integer between 1 and the number of processors.
# The objects will be evenly distributed among the k first
# processors, using the distribution method optionally specified by 
# the "initial distribution" option. 
#
# Example:
#     File Type = chaco, initial distribution = cyclic, initial procs = 2
# will give proc 0 objects 1, 3, 5, ... and proc 1 objects 2, 4, 6, ...
# while procs 2 and higher get no objects.
# NOTE:  The Fortran90 driver zfdrive does not read NemesisI files.
# NOTE:  The Fortran90 driver zfdrive does not accept any Chaco options.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Type		= NemesisI

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# File Name = <filename>
#
# This line contains the filename for the input finite element mesh.
#
# If the file type is NemesisI then this name refers to the base name
# of the parallel ExodusII files that contain the results. The base
# name is the parallel filename without the trailing .<# proc>.<file #>
# on it. This file must contain the Nemesis global information.
#
# If the file type is Chaco, this name refers to the base name of the
# Chaco files containing graph and/or coordinates information.  The
# file <filename>.graph will be read for the Chaco graph information;
# The file <filename>.coords will be read for Chaco geometry information.
# The optional file <filename>.assign may be read for an initial decomposition
# by specifying "initial distribution=file" on the "File Type" input line.
# For more information about the format of these files, see
# the Chaco user's guide.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Name	= testa.par

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Parallel Disk Info = <options>
#
# This line is OPTIONAL. If this line is left blank, then it is assumed
# that there is no parallel disk information, and all of the files are
# in a single directory.  This line is used only for Nemesis files.
#
# This line gives all of the information about the parallel file system
# being used. There are a number of options that can be used with it,
# although for most cases only a couple will be needed. The options are:
#
#       number=<integer> - this is the number of parallel disks that the
#                          results files are spread over. This number must
#                          be specified, and must be first in the options
#                          list. If zero (0) is specified, then all of the
#                          files should be in the root directory specified
#                          below.
#       list={list}      - OPTIONAL, If the disks are not sequential, then a
#                          list of disk numbers can be given. This list should
#                          be enclosed in brackets "{}", and the disk numbers
#                          can be seperated by any of the following comma,
#                          blank space, tab, or semicolon.
#       offset=<integer> - OPTIONAL, This is the offset from zero that the
#                          disk numbers begin with. If no number is specified,
#                          this defaults to 1. This option is ignored if
#                          "list" is specified.
#       zeros            - OPTIONAL, This specifies that leading zeros are
#                          used in the parallel file naming convention. For
#                          example, on the Paragon, the file name for the
#                          first pfs disk is "/pfs/tmp/io_01/". If this is
#                          specified, then the default is not to have leading
#                          zeros in the path name, such as on the teraflop
#                          machine "/pfs/tmp_1/".
#
# NOTE:  The Fortran90 driver zfdrive ignores this input line.

Parallel Disk Info	= number=4,zeros

#+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
# Parallel file location = <options>
#
# This line is OPTIONAL, only if the above line is excluded as well, or
# the number of raids is specified as zero (0). If this line is excluded,
# then the root directory is set to the execution directory, ".", and all
# files should be in that directory.  This line is used only for Nemesis 
# files.
#
# This line gives all of the information about where the parallel files are
# located. There are only two options for this line, and both must be
# specified. The options are:
#       root=<root directory name>
#         This line is used to specify what the name of the root directory is
#         on the target machine. This can be any valid root directory
#         name. For example, if one is running on an SGI workstation and
#         using the "tflop" numbering scheme then you could use something
#         similar to "/usr/tmp/pio_" in this field so that files would be
#         written to root directories named:
#               /usr/tmp/pio_1
#               /usr/tmp/pio_2
#                       .
#                       .
#                       .
#               /usr/tmp/pio_<Parallel Disk Info, number>
#
#       subdir=<subdirectory name>
#         This line specifies the name of the subdirectory, under the root
#         directory, where files are to be written. This is tacked onto
#         the end of the "root" after an appropriate integer is added to
#         "root". Continuing with the example given for "root", if "subdir"
#         had a value of "run1/input" files would be written to directories
#         named:
#               /usr/tmp/pio_1/run1/input/
#               /usr/tmp/pio_1/run1/input/
#                       .
#                       .
#                       .
#               /usr/tmp/pio_<Parallel Disk Info, number>/run1/input/
#
# NOTE:  The Fortran90 driver zfdrive ignores this input line.

Parallel File Location	= root=/pfs/io_, subdir=mmstjohn

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Zdrive debug level = <integer>
#
# This line is optional.  It sets a debug level within zdrive (not within
# Zoltan) that determines what output is written to stdout at runtime.
# The currently defined values are listed below.  For a given debug level
# value i, all debug output for levels <= i is printed.
#
# 	0   --  No debug output is produced.
#	1   --  Evaluation of the initial and final partition is done
#               through calls to driver_eval and Zoltan_LB_Eval.
#	2   --  Function call traces through major driver functions are
#               printed.
#       3   --  Generate output files of initial distribution.
#               Debug Chaco input files.
#       4   --  Entire distributed mesh (elements, adjacencies, communication
#               maps, etc.) is printed.  This output is done serially and can
#               be big and slow.
#
# Default value is 1.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Zdrive debug level = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# gnuplot output = <integer>
#
# This line is optional.  If the integer specified is greater than zero,
# zdrive produces files that can be plotted using gnuplot.  Each processor
# generates files containing its decomposition; these files are named
# similarly to the standard output filenames generated by zdrive but they
# include a "gnu" field.  A file containing the gnuplot commands to actually
# plot the decomposition is also generated; this file has a ".gnuload" suffix.
# To plot the results, start gnuplot; then type 
#   load "filename.gnuload"
# 
# The decomposition can be based on processor assignment or partition
# assignment.  See zdrive input line "plot partitions".
#
# For Chaco input files, edges are not drawn between neighboring subdomains (
# as Chaco input is balanced with respect to graph nodes).  Data style
# "linespoints" is used; this style can be changed using gnuplot's
# "set data style ..." command.
#
# In addition, processor assignments are written to the parallel Nemesis files
# to be viewed by other graphics packages (avs, mustafa, blot, etc.).  Note
# that the parallel Nemesis files must have space allocated for at least one
# elemental variable; this allocation is done by nem_spread.
#
# Gnuplot capability currently works only for 2D problems.
#
# Default value is 0.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
gnuplot output = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# nemesis output = <integer>
#
# This line is optional.  If the integer specified is greater than zero,
# zdrive writes subdomain assignment information to parallel nemesis files.  
# These files match the input nemesis file names, but contain a ".blot" suffix. 
# The SEACAS utility nem_join can combine these files into a single Exodus file 
# for plotting by blot, avs, mustafa, etc.  Note that the input parallel 
# Nemesis files must have space allocated for at least one
# elemental variable; this allocation is done by nem_spread.
#
# The decomposition can be based on processor assignment or partition
# assignment.  See zdrive input line "plot partitions".
#
# This option does nothing for Chaco input files.
#
# Default value is 0.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
nemesis output = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# plot partitions = <integer>
#
# This line is optional.  If the integer specified is greater than zero,
# zdrive writes partition assignments to the gnuplot or nemesis output files;
# one file per partition is generated.
# Otherwise, zdrive writes processor assignments to the gnuplot or nemesis
# output files, with one file per processor generated.
#
# See zdrive input lines "gnuplot output" and "nemesis output".
#
# Default value is 0 (processor assignments written).
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
plot partitions = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# print mesh info file = <integer>
#
# This line is optional.  If the integer specified is greater than zero,
# zdrive produces files describing the mesh connectivity.  Each processor
# generates a file containing its vertices (with coordinates) and elements
# (with vertex connectivity); these files are named
# similarly to the standard output filenames generated by zdrive but they
# include a ".mesh" suffix. 
# 
# Default value is 0.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
print mesh info file = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Chaco input assignment inverse = <integer>
#
# This line is optional.  It sets the IN_ASSIGN_INV flag, indicating that
# the "inverse" Chaco assignment format should be used if a Chaco assignment
# file is read for the initial decomposition.  If this flag is 0, the assignment
# file lists, for each vertex, the processor to which it is assigned.  If this
# flag is 1, the assignment file includes, for each processor, the number of
# vertices assigned to the processor followed by a list of those vertices.
# See the Chaco User's guide for a more detailed description of this parameter.
#
# Default value is 0.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chaco input assignment inverse = 0


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Number of Iterations = <integer>
#
# This line is optional.  It indicates the number of time the load-balancing
# method should be run on the input data.  The original input data is passed
# to the method for each invocation.  
# Multiple iterations are useful primarily for testing the RCB_REUSE parameter.
# 
# Default value is 1.
#
# NOTE:  The Fortran90 driver zfdrive ignores this input line.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Number of Iterations = 1

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# zdrive action = <integer>
#
# This line is optional.  It indicates the action the driver should take,
# typically load-balancing or ordering. Valid values are:
# 
# 	0   --  No action.
#	1   --  Load balance.
#	2   --  Order.
#	3   --  First load balance, then order.
#
# Default value is 1 (load balance).
#
# NOTE:  The Fortran90 driver zfdrive ignores this input line.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
zdrive action = 1


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Test Drops = <integer>
#
# This line signals that zdrive should exercise the box- and point-assign
# capability of Zoltan.  Note that the partitioning method must support
# box- and point-drop, and appropriate parameters (e.g., Keep_Cuts) must also
# be passed to Zoltan; otherwise, an error is returned from the box- and
# point-assign functions.
#
# Default value is 0.
#
# NOTE:  The Fortran90 driver zfdrive ignores this input line.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Drops = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Test DDirectory = <integer>
#
# This line signals that zdrive should exercise the Distributed Directory
# utility of Zoltan.  Comparisons between zdrive-generated communication maps
# and DDirectory-generated communication maps are done.  If a difference is
# found, a diagnostic message containing "DDirectory Test" is printed as 
# output from zdrive.
#
# Default value is 0.
#
# NOTE:  The Fortran90 driver zfdrive ignores this input line.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test DDirectory = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Test Null Import Lists = <integer>
#
# This line signals that zdrive should test Zoltan's capability to accept
# NULL import lists to Zoltan_Help_Migrate.  It allows the driver to pass NULL
# import lists.  This flag's value should not affect the output of zdrive.
#
# Default value is 0.
#
# NOTE:  The Fortran90 driver zfdrive ignores this input line.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Null Import Lists = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Test Multi Callbacks = <integer>
#
# This line signals that zdrive should test the list-based (MULTI) callback
# functions.  If this line is set to 1, zdrive registers list-based callback 
# functions.  Otherwise, callbacks on individual functions are registered.
# This flag's value should not affect the output of zdrive.
#
# Default value is 0.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Multi Callbacks = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Test Local Partitions = <integer>
#
# This line signals that zdrive should test Zoltan using various values
# of the NUM_LOCAL_PARTITIONS parameter and/or nonuniform partition sizes.
# While setting NUM_LOCAL_PARTITIONS using a "Zoltan Parameter" above
# would make all processors have the same number of local partitions,
# this flag allows different processors to have different values for
# NUM_LOCAL_PARTITIONS.
# Valid values are integers from 0 to 7.
#     0:  NUM_LOCAL_PARTITIONS is not set (unless specified as a 
#         "Zoltan Parameter" above).
#     1:  Each processor sets NUM_LOCAL_PARTITIONS to its processor number;
#         e.g., processor 0 requests zero local partitions; processor 1
#         requests 1 local partition, etc.
#     2:  Each odd-numbered processor sets NUM_LOCAL_PARTITIONS to its
#         processor number; even-numbered processors do not set 
#         NUM_LOCAL_PARTITIONS.  
#     3:  One partition per proc, but variable partition sizes.
#         Only set partition sizes for upper half of procs 
#         (using Zoltan_LB_Set_Part_Sizes and global partition numbers).
#     4:  Variable number of partitions per proc, and variable 
#         partition sizes. Proc i requests i partitions, each
#         of size 1/i.
#     5:  One partition per proc, but variable partition sizes.
#         Same as case 3, except all sizes are increased by one to 
#         avoid possible zero-sized partitions.
#     6:  One partition per proc, but variable partition sizes.
#         When nprocs >= 6, zero-sized partitions on processors >= 2.
#         (This case is of particular interest for HSFC.)
#     7:  One partition per proc, but variable partition sizes.
#         When nprocs >= 6, zero-sized partitions on processors <= 3.
#         (This case is of particular interest for HSFC.)
# 
# Default value is 0.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Local Partitions = 0

#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Test Generate Files = <integer>
#
# This line signals that zdrive should test Zoltan using Zoltan_Generate_Files
# to produce output files that describe the geometry, graph, or hypergraph
# used in the load-balancing. Such files may be useful for debugging.
#
#   0: Do not generate files.
#   1: Generate files.
#
# Default value is 0.
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Test Generate Files = 0
