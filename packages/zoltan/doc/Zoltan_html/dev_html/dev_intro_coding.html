<H3>
<A NAME="include"></A>Include files</H3>
Include files should be used for function prototypes, macro definitions,
and data structure definitions. The convention used is that external function
prototypes and data structure definitions
required by more than one module are stored in include files named
<I>*_const.h</I> (e.g., <I>zz/zz_const.h</I>). Include files with static
function prototypes or static data structure
definitions (i.e., files that are included in only one module) are
named <I>*.h</I> (e.g.,<I> rcb/rcb.h</I>).

<P>The include file <I>include/zoltan.h</I> contains the Zoltan
interface; it should be included by application source files that call
Zoltan. The include file <I>zz/zz_const.h</I> describes
the principle Zoltan data structures. As these data structures
are used heavily by the algorithms in Zoltan, <I>zz/zz_const.h</I>
should be included in most source files of Zoltan.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<A NAME="global"></A>Global variables</H3>
The use of global variables is highly discouraged in Zoltan.
In limited cases, static global variables can be tolerated within
a source file of an algorithm. However, developers should keep in mind
that several Zoltan structures may be used by an application, with
each structure using the same algorithm. Thus, global variables set by one
invocation of a routine may be reset by other invocations, causing errors
in the algorithms. Global variable names may also conflict with variables
used elsewhere in the library or application, causing unintended side-effects
and complicating debugging. For greatest robustness, developers are asked
NOT to use global variables in their algorithms. See <A HREF="dev_add_struct.html">Data
Structures</A> for ideas on avoiding the use of global variables.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<A NAME="functions"></A>Function Names</H3>
In order to avoid name conflicts with applications and other libraries,
all non-static functions should be prepended with <B>Zoltan_</B><I>.</I>&nbsp; 
Moreover, function names should, in general, include their module names; e.g., 
<b>Zoltan_HSFC_Box_Assign</b> is part of the HSFC module of Zoltan.
As a general
rule, each new word in a function name should be capitalized (for example,
<b>Zoltan_Invert_Lists</b>). 
Static Zoltan functions do not have to follow these rules.

<H3>
<A NAME="par_comm"></A>Parallel Communication</H3>
All communication in the Zoltan library should be performed through MPI
communication routines. The MPI interface was chosen to enable portability
to many different platforms. It will be especially important as the code
is extended to heterogeneous computing systems.

<P>Some useful communication utilities are provided within the library
to perform unstructured communication and synchronization. See <A HREF="../ug_html/ug_util_comm.html">Unstructured
Communication Utilities</A> and <A HREF="dev_services_parallel.html">Parallel
Computing</A>.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<A NAME="memory1"></A>Memory Management</H3>
It is strongly suggested that all memory allocation in the library is handled
using the functions supplied in <I>Utilities/Memory</I>. Use of these functions
will make debugging and maintenance of the library much easier as the library
gets larger. See <A HREF="../ug_html/ug_util_mem.html">Memory Management Utilities</A> for
more information on these utilities.<p>

For memory that is returned by Zoltan to an application, however, special
memory allocation functions must be used to maintain compatibility with
both C and Fortran90 applications.  See <a href="dev_add_memory.html">
Memory Management in Zoltan Algorithms</a> for more 
information. <p>

One of the few data types specified for use in the Zoltan interface is the
<a href="../ug_html/ug_usage.html#Data Types for Object IDs"><b>ZOLTAN_ID_PTR</b></a>
type used for global and local object identifiers (IDs).  Macros simplifying
and providing error checking for 
<a href="dev_lb_types.html">ID allocation and manipulation</a>
are provided.

<BR>&nbsp;
<H3>
<A NAME="return"></A>Errors, Warnings, and Return Codes</H3>
If an error or warning occurs in the Zoltan library, 
a message should be printed to
<i>stderr</i> (using one of the <a href="#ZOLTAN_PRINT">printing macros</a> below),
all memory allocated in the current function should be freed, and
an <a href="../ug_html/ug_interface.html#Error Codes">error code</a> should be returned. 
The Zoltan library should never "exit";
control should always be returned to the application with an error code.
The <a href="../ug_html/ug_interface.html#Error Codes">error codes</a> are defined in <i>include/zoltan_types.h</i>.
<p>
Currently, this philosophy is not strictly followed in all portions
of Zoltan.
Efforts are underway to bring existing code up-to-date, and to follow this
rule in all future development.
