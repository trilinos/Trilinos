<H2>
<A NAME="interface_fns"></A>Interface Functions</H2>
The interface to the Zoltan library is defined in the file
<I>include/zoltan.h</I>. This file should be included in application programs
that use Zoltan. It is also included in <I>zz/zz_const.h</I>,
which should be included by most Zoltan files to provide
access to the Zoltan data structures described below.

<P>In <I>include/zoltan.h</I>, the enumerated type <B>ZOLTAN_FN_TYPE</B> defines
the application query function types (e.g., <B><A HREF="../ug_html/ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_NUM_OBJ_FN">ZOLTAN_NUM_OBJ_FN_TYPE</A></B>
and <B><A HREF="../ug_html/ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_OBJ_LIST_FN">ZOLTAN_OBJ_LIST_FN_TYPE</A></B>).
The interface query routines (e.g., <B><A HREF="../ug_html/ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_NUM_OBJ_FN">ZOLTAN_NUM_OBJ_FN</A></B>
and <B><A HREF="../ug_html/ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_OBJ_LIST_FN">ZOLTAN_OBJ_LIST_FN</A></B>)
and their argument lists are defined as C type definitions (typedef). These
type definitions are used by the application developer to implement the
query functions needed for the application to use Zoltan.

<P>Prototypes for the Zoltan interface functions
(e.g., <B><A HREF="../ug_html/ug_interface_lb.html#Zoltan_LB_Partition">Zoltan_LB_Partition</A></B>
and <B><A HREF="../ug_html/ug_interface_mig.html#Zoltan_Migrate">Zoltan_Migrate</A></B>)
are also included in <I>include/zoltan.h</I>. Interface functions are called
by the application to register functions, select a load-balancing method,
invoke load balancing and migrate data.

<P>The interface to the C++ version of the Zoltan library is in the file
<I>include/zoltan_cpp.h</I>.  This file defines the <B>Zoltan</B> class,
representing a <B><A HREF="dev_lb_structs.html#Zoltan_Struct">Zoltan_Struct</A></B>
data structure and the functions which
operate upon it.  The conventions used to wrap C library functions as
C++ library functions are described in the chapter
<B><a href="dev_cpp.html">C++ Interface</a></B>.
A C++ program that uses Zoltan includes <I>include/zoltan_cpp.h</I>
instead of <I>include/zoltan.h</I>.

<P>For more detailed information on Zoltan's query and interface functions,
please see the <A HREF="../ug_html/ug.html">Zoltan User's Guide</A>.
