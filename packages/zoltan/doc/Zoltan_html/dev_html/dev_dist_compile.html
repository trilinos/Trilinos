<h2>
<a NAME="compilation"></a>Compilation and Makefiles</h2>
The Zoltan distribution includes a main (top-level) makefile with targets
for the Zoltan library, the test driver programs, and some graphical tools. 
When the library is
<a href="../ug_html/ug_usage.html#Building the Library">compiled for a specific target platform</a>, <i>A</i>, Autotools and CMake obtain provide
platform-specific configuration information.
<p>
Both the Autotools and CMake build systems must be maintained in Zoltan.
Thus, new source code files and directories must be added for both systems.
It is easiest to follow the examples of existing files in the build 
environments; good examples
are <i>hsfc.h</i>, <i>hsfc.c</i>, <i>dr_loadbal_const.h</i> and 
<i>dr_loadbal.c</i>.  
<p>
To add new source files or source directories:
<ul> 
<li> 
Autotools: Add new library files or directories to 
<i>zoltan/src/Makefile.am</i>; add
new driver files to <i>zoltan/src/driver/Makefile.am</i>.  
In the main
zoltan directory, run the <i>bootstrap-local</i> script to rebuild the 
automated Makefiles.
</li>
<li>
CMake:  Add new library files to <i>zoltan/src/CMakeLists.txt</i>; add
new driver files to <i>zoltan/src/driver/CMakeLists.txt</i>.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Alternatively, new algorithms can be added as separate libraries with which 
Zoltan may link.  
The implementation of the <a href="../ug_html/ug_alg_parmetis.html">ParMETIS</a>
interface in Zoltan can serve as an example.  
<p>
To add new third-party libraries:
<ul>
<li>
Autotools:  Add checks new library paths and include files to 
<i>zoltan/configure.ac</i>.  Search for the string "parmetis" in 
<i>zoltan/configure.ac</i>, and follow 
its example for the new library.  
Also edit 
<i>zoltan/src/include/Zoltan_config.h.in</i> to include a macro for
the new third-party library; follow the example of "HAVE_PARMETIS".
In the main
zoltan directory, run the <i>bootstrap-local</i> script to rebuild the 
automated configure and Makefiles.
</li>
<li>
CMake:
Follow the instructions in <i>Trilinos/cmake/HOWTO.ADD_TPL</i>
In <i>zoltan/src/CMakeLists.txt</i> 
and <i>zoltan/cmake/Zoltan_config.h.in</i>, 
follow the example of "HAVE_PARMETIS".
</li>
</ul>
