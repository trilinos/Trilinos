Using the Framework for Agile Software Testing (FAST)
for testing Zoltan interactively.

----------------------------------------------------
Part 0: Installing FAST
----------------------------------------------------

Get FAST, putting the test harness into ~/zoltan-th
	$ cd $HOME
	$ svn checkout https://software.sandia.gov/
		svn/public/exact/zoltan-th/trunk zoltan-th

    If svn hangs, it probably needs the proxy settings fixed in
    $HOME/.subversion/servers.  Break out of svn, and fix this at the
    bottom of the file in the [global] section and try again.
	[global]
	http-proxy-host = wwwproxy.sandia.gov
	http-proxy-port = 80

    Some machines don't have svn installed -- see your system admin
    to get it set up.

    The program you need for interactive testing is "exact", a python
    script located at $HOME/zoltan-th/fast/exact/src/exact/exact.
    The easiest way is to set an alias for this.
	$ alias exact=~/zoltan-th/fast/exact/src/exact/exact
    (or in csh)
	% alias exact ~/zoltan-th/fast/exact/src/exact/exact
    
    You also might need to specify the location of mpirun.
    (seamus and paunchy use
    "/Net/local/mpi/build/solaris/ch_p4/bin/mpirun -np")

	$ export EXACT_DRIVER="/usr/local/mpirun -np"
    (or in csh)
	% setenv EXACT_DRIVER "/usr/local/mpirun -np"

----------------------------------------------------
Part 1: Running interactively
----------------------------------------------------

    make and compile zoltan normally.  Assuming ZOLTAN_ARCH=gcc
	$ cd Zoltan
	$ gmake ZOLTAN_ARCH=gcc zoltan zdrive
	...

    create the basic teststudy files with the following command:
	$ cd test
	$ csh -f mktests

    This checks each subdirectory in Zoltan/test for zdrive.inp files,
    and makes a "study" file for each zdrive found.  In this case, it
    will create gcc.nightly.study.xml and gcc.smoke.study.xml in each
    subdirectory, if they don't already exist.  It also creates a
    checksum for the answers found.  This command only needs to be run
    once.

    You can modify zoltan.tests or zoltan.tests.smoke to make your own
    zdrive.inp sets.

    You can also modify or copy gcc.smoke.study.xml to point to a
    different zoltan.tests file.

    Run a simple test (smoke test) to see if things are working:
	$ cd hg_simple
	$ exact gcc.smoke.study.xml

    or run the full test, similar to test_zoltan
	$ cd hg_simple
	$ exact gcc.nightly.study.xml

    Output for the nightly run should look similar to this:
Experiment: gcc.nightly.exp1 ..........................................................
Analysis:   checksums.exp1 ........................F.................................
ID=25 Comb= numproc np=4 zdrive gcc zinput phg.initial_distribution.serial 
  Bad boolean statistic

    ('.' means pass, 'F' means failed)

    You can see phg.initial_distribution.serial failed the expected
    answers.  "Bad boolean statistic" in this case means simply that
    the checksum of the answers did not match.

    The experimental output is in a subdirectory of the experiment name,
    in this case "hg_simple/exp1".  Note ID=25 in the failure message,
    and you can examine the output with appropriate substitutions in
    hg_simple/exp1/gcc.nightly.exp1_25.0.out to see why it failed
    or the full program output in gcc.nightly.exp1_25.0.log.xml.

    The checksum could fail because the answer file doesn't exist, or
    that the answers are different.  Specifically, it looks at the
    parser output of "AllPass" to see whether all output files passed
    the checksum test.  If this is 0, it will fail.


----------------------------------------------------
Part 2: running regression tests
----------------------------------------------------

    Nightly regression tests can be installed on different platforms.
    A full writeup on FAST for generic systems is forthcoming, but in
    short, you simply edit the zoltan-th/config and have a cron job
    run zoltan-th/run_fast in that directory.

    The file zoltan.build will checkout the current repository, build,
    and run the system.  The system will summarize the tests in the
    next email at 8am.  run_fast can be started manually, and the results
    will be added to the next email.  The config file must have the
    current hostname and the tests to run.

    Mostly it involves checking out (via svn) zoltan-th, then creating
    a cron line to invoke run_fast (via crontab -e).

    The line used on seamus is (all one line):
    5 0 * * * (cd $HOME/zoltan-th; EXACT_DRIVER="/usr/local/bin/mpirun -np";
	export EXACT_DRIVER; ./run_fast) > $HOME/zoltan-th/cron.out 2>&1



----------------------------------------------------
Part 3: details details details
----------------------------------------------------

Special files of note:
----------------------------------------------------

zoltan.tests
zoltan.tests.smoke
  These files are referenced by *.study.xml and created by mktests.
  A sample zoltan.tests is:
      zinp=../hg_simple/zdrive.inp.phg _level_name=phg
      zinp=../hg_simple/zdrive.inp.phg.addobjwgt _level_name=phg.addobjwgt

  This means it will run two experiments (one per line), using zinput files
  of ../hg_simple/zdrive.inp.phg and ../hg_simple/zdrive.inp.phg.addobjwgt.
  The _level_name=xxx is so that the analysis output states what input
  failed, instead of just a cryptic ID=25.

  These input files are initially created by Zoltan/tests/mktests.  If you
  want to recreate, simply delete the zoltan.tests* and rerun mktests from
  the Zoltan/test directory.  You can also make up your own list of zinput
  files by modifying this file.  mktests should not overwrite an existing
  zoltan.test file.

gcc.nightly.study.xml
gcc.smoke.study.xml
  These are also created by mktests, by making substitutions in
  Zoltan/test/test.study.xml file.  These define the test study, and
  can be changed as needed.  Be careful running mktests, as it can
  overwrite changes.

NUMPROC
  This is a file with the number of processors to use.  If this file
  is missing from a test directory, it assumes 4 processors.  It's
  also possible to add the number of processors to the zoltan.tests
  file, by adding np=N on a particular line in the zoltan.tests file
  (e.g. np=6).  This will probably fail the checksum tests, unless the
  answerfiles for that many processors existed when you ran mktests.

checksums
  This is a list of the checksums of all the files in the answers
  directory, created by mktests.  Currently, the output isn't saved and
  merely compared to the checksum, but this behavior might change so
  that you can see the output when something failed.

Environment variables:
----------------------------------------------------

EXACT_DRIVER
  This is the mpirun command.  It defaults to "mpirun -np" and should
  be set to the appropriate command.

ZOLTAN_ARCH
  gcc,sun,solaris,linux,linux64,etc

ZOLTAN_ZDRIVE
  If you set ZOLTAN_ARCH, generally don't set this.  It is set based on
  ZOLTAN_ARCH to the default zdrive.  Set this if you need to run a specific
  zdrive in a nonstandard location.  It looks like "../../Obj_gcc/zdrive"
  or a full pathname.
