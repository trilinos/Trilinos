<A NAME="HSFC"></A>Appendix: Handling Degenerate Geometries</H2>

The geometry processed by one of the geometric methods
<a href="dev_rcb.html">RCB</a>, <a href="dev_rib.html">RIB</a>, or
<a href="dev_hsfc.html">HSFC</a> 
may be degenerate.  By this we mean
it may have 3-dimensional coordinates but be essentially flat, or 
it may have 3 or 2-dimensional coordinates but be essentially a line
in space.  If we treat the geometry as a lower dimensional object
for the purpose of partitioning, the result may be a more natural
partition (one the user would have expected) and a faster
run time.
<p>
The caller may set the <B>REDUCE_DIMENSIONS</B> parameter to TRUE
in any of the three geometric methods if they want Zoltan to check
for a degenerate condition and do lower dimensional partitioning
if such a condition if found.  They may set the <B>DEGENERATE_RATIO</B>
to specify how flat or thin a geometry must be to be considered
degenerate.
<p>

<H3>
Outline of Algorithm</H3>

All three geometric methods call 
<a href="dev_services_objlist.html#Zoltan_Get_Coordinates"><b>Zoltan_Get_Coordinates</b></a>
to obtain the
problem coordinates.  If <B>REDUCE_DIMENSIONS</B> is TRUE, we check
in this function to see if the geometry is degenerate.  If it is,
we transform the coordinates to the lower dimensional space, flag
that the problem is now lower dimensional, and return the transformed
coordinates.  The 
<a href="dev_rcb.html">RCB</a>, <a href="dev_rib.html">RIB</a>, or
<a href="dev_hsfc.html">HSFC</a> 
calculation is performed on the new coordinates in the lower dimensional
space.  
<p>
If <B>KEEP_CUTS</B> is TRUE, the transformation is saved so that in
<a href="../ug_html/ug_interface_augment.html#Zoltan_LB_Box_Assign"><b>Zoltan_LB_Box_Assign</b></a> or <a href="../ug_html/ug_interface_augment.html#Zoltan_LB_Point_Assign"><b>Zoltan_LB_Point_Assign</b></a>
the coordinates can be transformed before the assignment is calculated.
If <B>RCB_REUSE</B> is TRUE in the <a href="dev_rcb.html">RCB</a> method,
the transformation is also saved.  On re-partitioning, we can do some
simple tests to see if the degeneracy condition has changed before
completely re-calculating the coordinate transformation.
<p>
To determine if the geometry is degenerate, we calculate
the same inertial matrix that is calculated for <a href="dev_rib.html">RIB</a>,
except that we ignore vertex weights.  The 3 orthogonal eigenvectors
of the inertial matrix describe the three primary directions of the
geometry.  The bounding box oriented in these directions is tested
for degeneracy.  In particular (for a 3 dimensional geometry) if the
length of the longest side divided by the length of the shortest side
exceeds the DEGENERATE_RATIO, we consider the geometry to be flat.  If
in addition, the length longest side divided by the length of the
middle side exceeds the
DEGENERATE_RATIO, we consider the geometry to be essentially a line.
<p>
If a 3 dimensional geometry is determined to be flat, we transform
coordinates to a coordinate system where the XY plane corresponds 
to the oriented bounding box,
and project all coordinates to that plane.  These
X,Y coordinates are returned to the partitioning algorithm, which
performs two dimensional partitioning.  Similarly if the geometry
is very thin, we transform coordinates to a coordinate system
with the X axis going through the
bounding box in it's principal direction, and project all points to
that axis.  Then one dimensional partitioning is performed.
<p>
There is a small problem in calculating
<a href="../ug_html/ug_interface_augment.html#Zoltan_LB_Box_Assign"><b>Zoltan_LB_Box_Assign</b></a>
when the partitioning was performed
on transformed geometry.  The caller provides the box vertices in
problem coordinates, but the partition was calculated in
transformed coordinates.  When the vertices are transformed, they
are in general no longer the vertices of an axis-aligned box in
the new coordinate system.  The
<B>Box_Assign</B> calculation requires an axis-aligned box, and
so we use the bounding box of the transformed vertices.  The resulting
list of processes or parts intersecting the box may therefore
contain some processes or parts which actually do not intersect
the box in problem coordinates, however it will not omit any.


<H3>Data Structure Definitions</H3>
The transformation is stored in a <B>Zoltan_Transform_Struct</B>
structure which is
defined in <i>zz/zz_const.h</i>.  It is saved as part of the algorithm
specific information stored in the
<b><a href="dev_add_struct.html">LB.Data_Structure</a></b> field of the
<b><a href="dev_lb_structs.html#Zoltan_Struct">Zoltan_Struct</a></b>.
The flag that indicates whether the geometry was found to be 
degenerate is the <B>Target_Dim</B> field of this structure.
<p>
To use the degenerate geometry detection capability from a new
geometric method, you would add a <B>Zoltan_Transform_Struct</b>
structure to the algorithm specific data structure, add code to
<B>Zoltan_Get_Coordinates</B> to look for it, and check the
<B>Target_Dim</B> field on return to see if the problem dimension
was reduced.  You would also need to include the 
coordinate transformation in your Box_Assign and Point_Assign
functionality.
