<A NAME="CVS"></A>CVS</H2>
The source code and documentation for the Zoltan library is maintained
under the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) software. CVS allows multiple
developers to edit their own copies of the software and merges updated
versions with the developers' own versions.  Zoltan's repository
is part of the <a href="https://trilinos.sandia.gov">Trilinos</a> repository.

Developers must set the CVSROOT environment variable to the repository
directory:
<BLOCKQUOTE>setenv CVSROOT <i>username</i>@software.sandia.gov:/space/CVS
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <i>username</i> is the developer's username on the CVS server 
software.sandia.gov.
Since Zoltan is part of Trilinos, it is best to check out Trilinos from
the repository:
<BLOCKQUOTE>cvs checkout -P Trilinos</BLOCKQUOTE>
Zoltan is then in directory Trilinos/packages/zoltan.

<p>
Alternatively, one can get a working copy of only the Zoltan software:
<BLOCKQUOTE>cvs checkout -P zoltan</BLOCKQUOTE>
However, changes to the 
<a href="../ug_html/ug_usage.html#TrilinosAutotools">Autotools build 
environment</a> require directories above the Zoltan directory in
the Trilinos repository, so it is best to check out the entire Trilinos
repository.
