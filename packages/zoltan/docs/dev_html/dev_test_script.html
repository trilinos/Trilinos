<h2>
<a NAME="migration_help"></a>Appendix:&nbsp; Using the test script <i>test_zoltan</i></h2>
<B> 
Note:  The script <i>test_zoltan</i> as described below is obsolete.
It will work in some instances, but is no longer generally supported.  
<p>
Automated testing is now supported through CMake.  Build
<a href="../ug_html/ug_usage.html#CMake">Zoltan
through CMake</a> with option
<blockquote>
"-D Zoltan_ENABLE_Tests:BOOL=ON"
</blockquote>
<p>
Automated tests can be then run with command
<blockquote>
make test
</blockquote>
The testing environment uses script <i>zoltan/test/ctest_zoltan.pl</i>.  
To add new <i>zdrive.inp</i> files to an existing test, add the files to
the appropriate directory and to the glob commands in <i>ctest_zoltan.pl</i>.
(Follow the example of <i>zdrive.inp.rcb</i> in <i>ctest_zoltan.pl</i>.
<p>
To add new test directories, create the directories and populate them 
with input files.  Copy file <i>CMakeLists.txt</i> 
from <i>zoltan/test/ch_simple</i> to the new directories, 
and edit the test names and numbers of processors in the new files.  
Also add the new directories to <i>zoltan/test/CMakeLists.txt</i>, following
the example of <i>ch_simple</i>.  The new tests will now be run in the CMake
environment.

dashboard.

<p>
The purpose of the Zoltan test script is to run the test driver <i><a href="dev_driver.html">zdrive</a></i> (or 
<i><a href="dev_driver.html">zfdrive</a></i>)
on a set of test problems to verify that the Zoltan library works correctly.
The script compares the output of actual runs with precomputed output.
The assumption is that if the outputs are identical, then the current implementation
is is likely to be correct. 
Small differences may occur depending on the architectures used; developers
should examine the output and use their judgement in determining its correctness.
It is strongly recommended that developers
run <i>test_zoltan</i> to verify correctness before committing changes
to existing code!
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
How to run <i>test_zoltan</i></h3>
First make sure you have compiled the driver <i><a href="dev_driver.html">zdrive</a></i> (or <i><a href="dev_driver.html">zfdrive</a></i>).&nbsp;
Then go to the Zoltan directory <i>Zoltan/tests</i> and type<i> test_zoltan </i>
with suitable options as described below. This will run the test script
in interactive mode. The output from the driver will be sent to <i>stdout</i> 
and <i>stderr</i<i>stdout</i> 
and <i>stderr</i>
with a summary of results. The summary of results is also saved in a log
file. If&nbsp; an error occured, look at the log file to find out what
went wrong. The script currently assumes that runs are deterministic
and reproducible across all architectures,
which is not necessarily true.
Hence false alarms may occur.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Syntax</h3>
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; test_zoltan </b>[-arch <i>arch-type</i>] [-cmd
<i>command</i>]
[other options as listed below] 
<p>It is required to use either the -arch or the -cmd option.&nbsp; The
other arguments are optional.
<p>
<table BORDER=0 WIDTH="100%" NOSAVE >
<tr VALIGN=TOP>
<td WIDTH="25%"><b>Options:</b></td>
<td WIDTH="75%"></td>
</tr>
<tr VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>
<td WIDTH="25%" NOSAVE>-arch <i>arch-type</i></td>

<td WIDTH="75%" NOSAVE>The architecture on which the driver is to run.  For a 
list of currently supported architectures, type <i>test_zoltan</i> with no 
arguments.
</td>

</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>
<td>-cmd <i>command</i></td>

<td>The <i>command</i> is the command that the script
uses to launch the driver. One must include an option to specify the number
of processors as part of the command. Use quotes appropriately; for example,
<i>-cmd
'mpirun -np'</i>. Default settings have been provided for all the supported
architectures.</td>

</tr>

<tr VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>
<td>-logfile <i>filename</i></td>

<td NOSAVE>The name of the log file. The default is <i>test_zoltan.log</i>.
If an old log file exists, it will be moved to <i>test_zoltan.log.old.</i></td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>-no_parmetis</td>

<td>Do not run any <a href="../ug_html/ug_alg_parmetis.html">ParMETIS</a> 
methods.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>-no_nemesis</td>

<td>Do not run test problems in Nemesis format.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>-no_chaco</td>

<td>Do not run test problems 
in <a href="http://cs.sandia.gov/CRF/chac.html">Chaco</a> format.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>-yes_fortran</td>

<td>Run the Fortran90 driver <a href="dev_driver.html"><i>zfdrive</i></a> 
instead of <i>zdrive</i>.</td>

</tr>
</table>

<p>The default behavior is to run 
<a href="dev_driver.html"><i>zdrive</i></a>
all methods on all types of input format.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Test problems</h3>
The test problems are included in subdirectories of the <i>Zoltan/test</i>
directory.  Problems using  <a href="http://cs.sandia.gov/CRF/chac.html">Chaco</a> input files are in subdirectories
<i>ch_*</i>; problems using Nemesis input files are in subdirectories
<i>nem_*</i>.
Please see the README files located in each test directory for more
details on these test problems.
<h3>
Load balancing methods</h3>
Many different load-balancing methods are currently tested in <i>test_zoltan</i>.
Input files for the methods are found in the test problem subdirectories.
The input files are named <i>zdrive.inp.&lt;method&gt;</i>, where <i>&lt;method&gt;</i> indicates which load-balancing method is passed to Zoltan.
To run only a subset of the methods, 
edit the <i>test_zoltan</i> script manually; searching for "rcb" shows
which lines of the script must be changed.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<b>Number of processors</b></h3>
The script <i>test_zoltan</i> runs each test problem on a predetermined number of processors, currently
ranging from 3 to 9.
