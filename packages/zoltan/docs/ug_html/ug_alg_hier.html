<A NAME="Hier"></A>Hierarchical Partitioning (HIER)</H2>

Hierarchical partitioning refers to a sequence of partitionings,
where each level in the sequence refines the partitions computed in
the prevous level.  Zoltan provides two ways to perform hierarchical
partitioning, one targeted to heterogeneous distributed systems, and
one targeted to machines with multiple multicore processors.
<p>
Partitioning to the hierarchy of a distributed system is described 
<a href="#HierDist">below</a>.  Employing callbacks to the user at
each level, Zoltan will balance the problem across platforms of 
varying capabilities while minimizing communication 
along slower links.
<p>
Partitioning an application to run on a multicore machine, where the
multicore nodes are expected to be homogeneous in architecture, is
described in the <a href="#HierMC"> next </a> section.  Using a parameter
supplied by the application which describes node topology, Zoltan will partition
the problem to balance computation while minimizing inter-node communication,
and communication between on-node structures.

<H3>
<A NAME="HierMC"></A>Hierarchical Partitioning for multicore machines</H2>

With this method, Zoltan computes partitions that balance computation and 
minimize communication costs on multicore architectures.  

<p>
Some limitations of this method to note are that Zoltan assumes:
<ul>
<li>Each node (processor) of the multicore machine has the same architecture.
<li>The MPI process ranks are consecutive on the multicore nodes.
</ul>

<p>
In particular, if your parameters imply there are 4 MPI processes on each multicore node, Zoltan will assume that processes 0, 1, 2 and 3 are on the same node.  Your system administrator should be able to show you how to ensure that your processes are loaded in this order.
<p>
The results shown below emphasize that the benefit to be gained from levels of
hierarchical partitioning is very dependent on the commmunication patterns 
of the problem.

<A NAME="HierDist"></A>Hierarchical Partitioning for distributed computing</H2>


Hierarchical partitioning allows the creation of hybrid partitions,
computed using combinations of other Zoltan procedures.
For hierarchical and heterogeneous systems, different choices may be
appropriate in different parts of the parallel environment.  There are
tradeoffs in execution time and partition quality (<I>e.g.</I>, surface
indices/communication volume, interprocess connectivity, strictness of load
balance) and some may be more important than others
in some circumstances.  For example, consider a cluster of symmetric
multiprocessor (SMP) nodes connected by Ethernet.  A more costly graph
partitioning can be done to partition among the nodes, to minimize
communication across the slow network interface, possibly at the
expense of some computational imbalance.  Then, a fast geometric
algorithm can be used to partition independently within each node.<P>

Zoltan's hierarchical balancing, implemented by Jim Teresco (Williams
College) during a 2003-04 visit to Sandia, automates the creation of
hierarchical partitions [<U><A HREF="ug_refs.html#para04">Teresco,
<I>et al.</I></A></U>].  It can be used directly by an application or
be guided by the tree representation of the computational environment
created and maintained by the <A
HREF="https://www.cs.williams.edu/drum/">Dynamic Resource Utilization
Model (DRUM)</A> [<U><A HREF="ug_refs.html#adapt03">Devine, <I>et
al.</I> </A>, <A HREF="ug_refs.html#cluster04">Faik, <I>et
al.</I></A>, <A HREF="ug_refs.html#cise05">Teresco, <I>et
al.</I></A></U>]. 
<!-- DRUM is a software system that supports automatic
resource-aware partitioning and dynamic load balancing for
heterogeneous, non-dedicated, and hierarchical computing environments.
DRUM dynamically models the computing environment using a tree
structure that encapsulates the capabilities and performance of
communication and processing resources.  The tree is populated with
performance data obtained from <I>a priori</I> benchmarks and dynamic
monitoring agents that run concurrently with the application.  It is
then used to guide partition-weighted and hierarchical partitioning
and dynamic load balancing.  Partition-weighted balancing is available
through <A HREF="ug_drum.html">Zoltan's DRUM interface</A>. --><P>

The hierarchical balancing implementation utilizes a lightweight
intermediate structure and a set of callback functions that permit an
automated and efficient hierarchical balancing which can use any of
the procedures available within Zoltan without modification and in any
combination.  Hierachical balancing is invoked by an application the
same way as other Zoltan procedures and interfaces with
applications through callback functions.  A hierarchical balancing
step begins by building an intermediate structure using these
callbacks.  This structure is an augmented version of the graph
structure that Zoltan builds to make use of the ParMetis and
Jostle libraries.  The hierarchical balancing
procedure then provides its own callback functions to allow existing
Zoltan procedures to be used to query and update the intermediate
structure at each level of a hierarchical balancing.  After all levels
of the hierarchical balancing have been completed, Zoltan's usual
migration arrays are constructed and returned to the application.
Thus, only lightweight objects are migrated internally between levels,
not the (larger and more costly) application data.<P>

Hierarchical partitioning requires three callback functions to specify
the number of levels (<B><A
HREF="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_HIER_NUM_LEVELS_FN">ZOLTAN_HIER_NUM_LEVELS_FN</A></B>),
which parts each process should compute at each level (<B><A
HREF="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_HIER_PART_FN">ZOLTAN_HIER_PART_FN</A></B>),
and which method and parameters to be used at each level (<B><A
HREF="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_HIER_METHOD_FN">ZOLTAN_HIER_METHOD_FN</A></B>).
These are in addition to the callbacks needed to specify objects,
coordinates, and graph edges.  This fairly cumbersome interface can be
avoided by using the separately available <A
HREF="https://www.cs.williams.edu/~terescoj/research/zoltanParams/">zoltanParams</A>
library.  This allows a file-based description to replace these
callbacks.  A more direct interface with DRUM's hierarchical machine
model is also planned, allowing hierarchical balancing parameters to
be set by a graphical configuration tool.<P>

We use a simple example to illustrate the use of the callback
mechanism to specify hierarchical a hierarchical partitioning.  In the
figure <a href="#HierFigure">below</a>, a hierarchical computing
environment and a desired hierarchical partitioning is shown.

<p>

Assume we start one process for each processor, with the processes of
ranks 0-3 assigned to Node 0, 4-7 to Node 1, 8-11 to Node 2, and 12-15
to Node 3.  When hierarchical partitioning is invoked, the following
callbacks will be made, and the following actions should be taken by
the callbacks on each node.

<OL>

<LI>The <B><A
HREF="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_HIER_NUM_LEVELS_FN">ZOLTAN_HIER_NUM_LEVELS_FN</A></B>
callback is called.  All processes should return 2, the number of
levels in the hierarchy.

<LI>The <B><A
HREF="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_HIER_PART_FN">ZOLTAN_HIER_PART_FN</A></B>
callback is called, with a <B>level</B> parameter equal to 0.  This
means the callback should return, on each process, the part
number to be computed at level 0 by that process.  Since in our
example, the 16 processes are computing a four-way partition at level
0, processes with ranks 0-3 should return 0, ranks 4-7 should return
1, 8-11 should return 2, and 12-15 should return 3.

<LI>The <B><A
HREF="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_HIER_METHOD_FN">ZOLTAN_HIER_METHOD_FN</A></B>
callback is called, with a <B>level</B> parameter equal to 0, and the
Zoltan_Struct that has been allocated internally by the hierarchical
partitioning procedure is passed as <B>zz</B>.  The callback should
use Zoltan_Set_Param to specify an LB_METHOD and any other parameters
that should be done by the four-way partition across the 16 processes
at level 0.  In this case, two calls might be appropriate:

<PRE>
  Zoltan_Set_Param(zz, "LB_METHOD", "PARMETIS");
  Zoltan_Set_Param(zz, "PARMETIS_METHOD", "PARTKWAY");
</PRE>

At this point, Zoltan's hierarchical balancing procedure can proceed
with the level 0 partition, using ParMetis' PARTKWAY method to
produce a four-way partition across the 16 processes, with part 0
distributed among the processes with ranks 0-3, part 1
distributed among 4-7, part 2 distributed among 8-11, and
part 3 distributed among 12-15.


<LI>The <B><A
HREF="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_HIER_PART_FN">ZOLTAN_HIER_PART_FN</A></B>
callback is called again, this time with <B>level</B> equal to 1.  At
level 1, each group of four processes on the same node is responsible for
computing its own four-way partition.  To specify this, processes with
ranks 0, 4, 8, and 12 should return 0, ranks 1, 5, 9, and 13 should
return 1, ranks 2, 6, 10, and 14 should return 2, and ranks 3, 7, 11,
and 15 should return 3.  Note that we are specifying four separate four-way
partitions at this level, so each group of four processes on the same
node will have one process computing each part 0, 1, 2, and 3,
for that group.

<LI>The <B><A
HREF="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_HIER_METHOD_FN">ZOLTAN_HIER_METHOD_FN</A></B>
callback is called again, with <B>level</B> equal to 1, and another
internally-allocated Zoltan_Struct passed as <B>zz</B>.  Here, we want
all processes to be computing a partition using recursive inertial
bisection.  The following call would be appropriate inside the
callback:

<PRE>
  Zoltan_Set_Param(zz, "LB_METHOD", "RIB");
</PRE>

Additional Zoltan_Set_Param calls would be used to specify any
additional procedures.  Note that in this case, we are computing four
separate partitions but all with the same LB_METHOD.  It would be
allowed to specify different LB_METHODs for each group, but all
processes cooperating on a partition must agree on their LB_METHOD
and other parameters (just like any other Zoltan partitioning).
<P>

At this point, Zoltan's hierarchical balancing procedure can proceed
with the level 1 partition, using four independent recursive inertial
bisections produce the four four-way partitions across the processes on
each node.  Since this is the final level, the 16 resulting parts
are returned by the hierarchical balancing procedure to the calling
application.
