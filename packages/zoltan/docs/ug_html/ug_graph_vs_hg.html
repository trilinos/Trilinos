</a>Graph vs Hypergraph Partitioning</h2>

Graph partitioning has proven quite useful in scientific computing. 
<a href="ug_alg_hypergraph.html">Hypergraph partitioning</a>
is a more recent improvement
that uses a hypergraph model, which is
often a more accurate model than the graph model for scientific computing. 
(Hypergraphs contain hyperedges which connect two <i>or more</i>
vertices.)
See <a href="ug_refs.html#catalyurek99">[Catalyurek & Aykanat]</a> and
<a href="ug_refs.html#hendrickson-kolda">[Hendrickson & Kolda]</a> 
for further details. 

You do not need to understand the underlying models
to use graph or hypergraph partitioning for load-balancing
in Zoltan. The basic trade-offs are:
<ul>
<li> Hypergraph partitioning usually produces partitions (assignments)
of higher quality than graph partitioning, which may reduce
communication time in parallel applications (up to 30-40%
reduction has been reported). However, hypergraph
partitioning takes longer time to compute. </li>
<li> The graph model is restricted to symmetric data dependencies. 
If you have a non-symmetric problem, we recommend hypergraph 
partitioning. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Migrating from ParMetis to PHG in Zoltan</h3>
If you already use Zoltan for graph partitioning (via ParMetis),
there are three ways to switch to the Zoltan-PHG hypergraph partitioner: 

<ol>
<li>The quick and easy way: Just change the <a href="ug_alg.html#LB_METHOD">
LB_METHOD</a> to "Hypergraph".
Zoltan will then use the graph query functions (presumably
already implemented) to construct a hypergraph model, which
is similar to but not equivalent to the graph.
<li>The proper way: Change the LB_METHOD, but also implement and
register the <a href="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_HG_SIZE_CS_FN">
hypergraph query functions</a>
required by Zoltan. These may give a more accurate representation
of data dependencies (and communication requirements) for your
application.
<li>If you really want graph (not hypergraph) partitioning: 
Just change the <a href="ug_alg.html#LB_METHOD">
LB_METHOD</a> to "Graph".
Zoltan will then use PHG as a graph partitioner, which is slower than
ParMetis but often produces better partitions (lower cuts).
</ol>

Technical note: A hypergraph is constructed from the graph as follows:
The vertices are the same in the hypergraph as in the graph. For each vertex
<i>v</i>, create a hyperedge that consists of all neighbors in the graph 
and <i>v </i> itself.
