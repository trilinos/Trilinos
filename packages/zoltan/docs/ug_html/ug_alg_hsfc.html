<h2>
<a NAME="HSFC"></a>Hilbert Space Filling Curve (HSFC)</h2>
The Inverse Hilbert Space-Filling Curve functions map a point in one, two or three dimensions
into the interval [0,1].  The Hilbert functions that map [0, 1] to normal spatial
coordinates are also provided. (The one-dimensional inverse Hilbert curve is defined here
as the identity function, f(x)=x for all x.)
<p>
The HSFC partitioning algorithm seeks to divide [0,1] into P intervals each containing
the same weight of objects associated to these intervals by their inverse Hilbert
coordinates. N bins are created (where N > P) to partition [0,1].  The weights in
each bin are summed across all processors.
A greedy algorithm sums the bins (from left to right) placing a cut when the desired weight
for current part interval is achieved.
This process is repeated as needed to improve partitioning tolerance by
a technique that maintains the same total number of bins but refines the bins previously
containing a cut.
<p>
HSFC returns an warning if the final imbalance exceeds the user specified tolerance.
<p>
This code implements both the point assign and box assign functionality.  The point
assign determines an appropriate part (associated with a specific group of processors)
for a new point.   The box assign determines the list of processors
whose associated subdomains intersect the given box.  In order to
use either of these routines, the user parameter KEEP_CUTS must be turned on.
Both point assign and box assign now work for points or boxes anywhere in space even if
they are exterior to the original bounding box.  If a part is empty (due to the
part being assigned zero work), it is not included in the list of parts
returned by box assign.  Note: the original box assign algorithm was not rigorous and
may have missed parts.  This version is both rigorous and fast.
<p>
The Zoltan implementation of HSFC has one parameter that can be modified
by the <b><a href="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Set_Param">Zoltan_Set_Param</a></b>
function.
<p>
This partitioning algorithm is loosely based on the 2D & 3D Hilbert tables used in the Octree
partitioner and on the BSFC partitioning implementation by Andrew C. Bauer, Department
of Engineering, State University of New York at Buffalo, as his summer project at SNL
in 2001.  The box assign algorithm is loosely based on the papers by Lawder referenced both
in the developers guide and the code itself.  NOTE: This code can be trivially extended to
any space filling curve by providing the tables implementing the curve's state transition
diagram.  The only dependance on the curve is through the tables and the box assign
algorithm will work for all space filling curves (if we have their tables.)
<p>
Please refer to the Zoltan Developers Guide,

When a 3 dimensional geometry is almost flat, it may make more
sense to treat it as a 2 dimensional geometry when applying the HSFC 
algorithm.  (Coordinate values in the omitted direction are ignored                  for the purposes of partitioning.)
If this parameter is set to <B>1</B>, a 3 dimensional
geometry will be treated as 2 dimensional if is very flat,
or 1 dimensional if it very thin.  And a 2 dimensional geometry will
be treated as 1 dimensional if it is very thin.
Turning this parameter on removes the possibility that disconnected
parts will appear on the surface of a flat 3 dimensional object.

If the <B>REDUCE_DIMENSIONS</B> parameter is set, then this parameter
determines when a geometry is considered to be flat.
A bounding box which is oriented to the geometry is constructed, and
the lengths of its sides are tested against a ratio of 1 : <B>DEGENERATE_RATIO</B>.
