<h2>
<a NAME="RIB"></a>Recursive Inertial Bisection (RIB)</h2>
An implementation of Recursive Inertial Bisection (RIB) is included in
Zoltan. RIB was proposed as a load-balancing algorithm by 
<a href="ug_refs.html#williams">Williams</a> and later studied 
by <a href="ug_refs.html#taylor">Taylor and Nour-Omid</a>, but its 
origin is unclear.  RIB is similar to RCB in that it divides the domain based on
the location of the objects being partitioned by use of cutting planes.
In RIB, the computational domain is first divided into two regions by a
cutting plane orthogonal to the longest direction of the domain so that half
the work load is in each of the sub-regions.  The sub-regions are then further
divided by recursive application of the same splitting algorithm until
the number of sub-regions equals the number of processors.  Although this
algorithm was first devised to cut into a number of sets which is a power
of two, the set sizes in a particular cut needn't be equal.  By adjusting
the part sizes appropriately, any number of equally-sized sets can
be created.  If the parallel machine has processors with different speeds,
sets with nonuniform sizes can also be easily generated.  The Zoltan implementation
of RIB has several parameters which can be modified by the <b><a href="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Set_Param">Zoltan_Set_Param</a></b>
function.
<p>
RIB currently does not support multiple vertex weights. For such cases, use RCB instead.

within the RIB algorithm when additional storage is due to changes in processor
assignments.&nbsp;
<br>1.0 = no extra storage allocated; 1.5 = 50% extra storage; etc.</td>

<td>Should information about the cuts determining the RIB decomposition
be retained? It costs a bit of time to do so, but this information is necessary
if application wants to add more objects to the decomposition via calls
to <b><a href="ug_interface_augment.html#Zoltan_LB_Point_PP_Assign">Zoltan_LB_Point_PP_Assign</a></b>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> AVERAGE_CUTS</i></td>

<td>When set to one, coordinates of RIB cutting planes are computed to be the
average of the coordinates of the closest object on each side of the cut.
Otherwise, coordinates of cutting planes may equal those of one of the
closest objects.
<br>0 = don't average cuts; 1 = average cuts.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> REDUCE_DIMENSIONS</i></td>
<td>
When a 3 dimensional geometry is almost flat, it may make more
sense to treat it as a 2 dimensional geometry when applying the RIB
algorithm.  (Coordinate values in the omitted direction are ignored
for the purposes of partitioning.)
If this parameter is set to <B>1</B>, a 3 dimensional
geometry will be treated as 2 dimensional if it is very flat,
or 1 dimensional if it is very thin.  A 2 dimensional geometry will
be treated as 1 dimensional if it is very thin.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td VALIGN=TOP NOSAVE>&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> DEGENERATE_RATIO</i></td>
<td>
If the <B>REDUCE_DIMENSIONS</B> parameter is set, then this parameter
determines when a geometry is considered to be degenerate.
A bounding box which is oriented to the geometry is constructed, and
the lengths of its sides are tested against a ratio of 1 : <B>DEGENERATE_RATIO</B>.
