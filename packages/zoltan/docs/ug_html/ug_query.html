<h2>
<a NAME="Application-Registered Query Functions"></a>Application-Registered
Query Functions</h2>
Zoltan gets information about a processor's objects
through calls to query functions. These functions
must be provided by the application. They are "registered" with Zoltan; 
that is, a pointer to the function is passed to Zoltan, 
which can then call that function when its information is needed.&nbsp;
<p>
Query functions return information about only on-processor data.
They can be called by Zoltan with individual objects
or lists of objects.  Each processor may call a given query function
zero, one or
more than one time.  Thus, most query functions should NOT contain 
interprocessor communication, as such communication can cause 
processors to hang while
waiting for messages that were never sent. (The only exceptions to this rule 
are certain <a href="ug_query_mig.html">migration query functions</a>.)
<p>
Two categories of query functions are used by the library:
<blockquote><a href="ug_query_lb.html">General Zoltan Query Functions</a>
<br><a href="ug_query_mig.html">Migration Query Functions</a></blockquote>
In each category, a variety of query functions can be registered by the
user. The query functions have a function type, describing their 
purpose.&nbsp; Functions can be registered with a
Zoltan structure in two ways:&nbsp; through calls to <b><a href="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Set_Fn">Zoltan_Set_Fn</a></b>
or through calls to query-function-specific functions <b><a href="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Set_Specific_Fn">Zoltan_Set_&lt;<i>zoltan_fn_type</i>>_Fn</a></b>.&nbsp;
When a function is registered through a call to <b><a href="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Set_Fn">Zoltan_Set_Fn</a></b>,
its function type is passed in the <i>fn_type</i> argument. When <b><a href="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Set_Specific_Fn">Zoltan_Set_&lt;<i>zoltan_fn_type</i>>_Fn</a></b>
is used to register functions, the type of the function is implicit in
the <i>fn_ptr</i> argument.&nbsp; Each function description below includes
both its function type and function prototype.
<p>
Query functions that return information about data objects owned by a processor
come in two forms:  list-based functions that return information about a 
list of objects, and iterator functions that return information about a single 
object.
Users can provide either version of the query function; they need not provide
both.
Zoltan calls the list-based functions with the IDs of all objects needed;
this approach often provides faster performance as it eliminates the overhead
of multiple function calls.  List-based functions have the word "MULTI" in 
their function-type name.  If, instead, the application provides iterator
functions, Zoltan calls the iterator function once for each object whose 
data is needed.  This approach, while slower, allows Zoltan to use less memory
for some data.
<p>
Some algorithms in Zoltan require that certain query
functions be registered by the application; for example, geometric partitioning
algorithms such as Recursive Coordinate Bisection (RCB) require that either a
<b><a href="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_GEOM_FN">ZOLTAN_GEOM_FN</a></b> or a 
<b><a href="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_GEOM_MULTI_FN">ZOLTAN_GEOM_MULTI_FN</a></b> 
be registered. When a default value is specified below, the query function
type is optional; if a function of that type is not registered, the default
values are used. Details of which query functions are required by particular
algorithms are included in the <a href="ug_alg.html">Algorithms</a> section.
<p>
Many of the functions have both global and local object identifiers
(IDs) in their argument lists. The global IDs provided by the application
must be unique across all processors; they are used for identification
within Zoltan. The local IDs are not used by Zoltan; 
they are provided for the convenience of the application and can
be anything the application desires. The local IDs can be used by application
query routines to enable direct access to application data. For example,
the object with global ID "3295" may be stored by the application in location
"15" of an array in the processor's local memory. Both global ID "3295"
and local ID "15" can be used by the application to describe the object.
Then, rather than searching the array for global ID "3295," the application
query routines can subsequently use the local ID to index directly into
the local storage array. See <a href="ug_usage.html#Data Types for Object IDs">Data
Types for Object IDs</a> for a description of global and local IDs. All
of the functions have, as their first argument, a pointer to data that
is passed to Zoltan through <b><a href="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Set_Fn">Zoltan_Set_Fn</a></b>
or <b><a href="ug_interface_init.html#Zoltan_Set_Specific_Fn">Zoltan_Set_&lt;<i>zoltan_fn_type</i>>_Fn</a></b>.&nbsp;
This data is not used by Zoltan. A different set of
data can be supplied for each registered function. For example, if the
local ID is an index into an array of data structures, then the data pointer
might point to the head of the data structure array.
<p>As their last argument, all functions have 
an <a href="ug_interface.html#Error Codes">error code</a> that should
be set and returned by the registered function. 
<p>
If you are calling the Zoltan library from a C++ application, you may
set the query function to be any class static function
or any function
defined outside of a class definition.  However, it is possible you
will wish to set the query function to be an object method.
In that case, you should
write a query function that takes a pointer to the object as its
<I>data</I> field.  The query function can then call the object
method.
