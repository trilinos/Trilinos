<hr>
<h2><a name="Release3.83">Zoltan Release v3.83 in Trilinos v12.6; January 2016</a></h2>
<ul>
<li> Autotools files updated to avoid deprecated perl features </li>
<li> Added Zoltan_Get_Fn interface to return pointers to registered callback
functions.</li>
<li> Several bug fixes in Fortran90 interface </li>
<li> Subtle rounding error fixed in PHG hypergraph partitioner </li>
<li> Minor changes to distributed data directory to track number of nodes
per processor; include file DD.h is now named zoltan_dd_const.h </li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Release3.82">Zoltan Release v3.82 in Trilinos v12; May 2015</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>  Minor code clean-up to remove compiler warnings and handle error conditions.
<li>  Enable "make -j" when building Zoltan's Fortran90 interface with autotools.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Release3.81">Zoltan Release v3.81 in Trilinos v11.12; November 2014</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>  Several improvements were made to Zoltan's interface to ParMETIS v4,
METIS v5, and Scotch v6. 
<li>  New statistics were added to the RCB and RIB algorithms' output.
<li>  Checks for MPI_VERSION 1 or 2 were added where appropriate to handle
MPI interface changes.
<li>  For non-MPI builds of Zoltan, a bug in the serial MPI stubs siMPI was 
fixed; the bug occurred when many MPI_Datatypes were defined by the 
algorithm (e.g., in deep recursion level of multilevel partitioning methods).
<li>  Several minor bugs were fixed.
<li>  No Zoltan interfaces were changed; Zoltan 3.81 is fully 
backward-compatible with Zoltan 3.8.
</ul> 
<hr>
<h2><a name="Release3.8">Zoltan Release Notes v3.8: October 2013</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>  An improved hash function reduces execution time in partitioning, 
particularly when parameter RETURN_LISTS=PARTS is used.
<li>  Several bug fixes address overflow issues in cases where integers A and B
are valid integers, but A*B overflows an integer.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Release3.7">Zoltan Release Notes v3.7: September 2012</a></h2>
<ul>
<li> The following features (deprecated in Trilinos v10.8) are no longer
supported in Trilinos v11.
<ul>
<li>Zoltan is now released under Trilinos' BSD license.
<li> Zoltan v1.1 interface (as described in Zoltan include file lbi_const.h):
users should upgrade their Zoltan interface and include file zoltan.h.
Instructions are at the <a href="../Zoltan_FAQ.html">Zoltan FAQ page</a>.
<li> Partitioning method OCTPART:  use partitioning method HSFC for similar
partitions with faster partitioning time.
<li> Use of DRUM as a Zoltan TPL:  architecture-aware methods will be included
in Zoltan2.
</ul>
<li> Improved memory usage in Zoltan Distributed Data Directories.  Memory is
now managed in a single block, eliminating excessive calls to malloc and
improving the runtime performance of the data directories and the
hierarchical partitioning algorithms that use them.
<li> Hierarchical partitioning received several performance, interface and 
testing improvements.  In particular, an easier-to-use interface has been 
added using simple parameters (HIER_ASSIST, PLATFORM_NAME, TOPOLOGY)
instead of callback functions; the callback function interface is still
supported.  Also, hierarchical partitioning can now be used with only
geometric partitioners and callbacks, whereas before it required 
graph-based callbacks as well.
<li> Reduced the memory usage of RCB and RIB when parameter KEEP_CUTS=0.
<li> Increased use of point-to-point communication (instead of MPI_Alltoall)
in communication package for better performance on large number of 
processors.
<li> Compilation with gcc 4.7 is now supported.
<li> Using MurmurHash for better hashing.  
<li>  Zoltan supports PT-Scotch v5.1.12 and ParMETIS v4, as well as some older
versions of these TPLs. 
<li> Zoltan's graph build has been streamlined; if possible, use the parameter
"GRAPH_BUILD_TYPE" == "FAST_NO_DUP" for faster graph builds.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Release3.6">Zoltan Release Notes v3.6: September 13, 2011</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>
Added new recoloring capability to Zoltan coloring algorithms, providing 
lower numbers of colors at small additional cost.
</li>
<li>
Updated Zoltan to allow use of third-party libraries ParMETIS versions 3.1 and 4.0 and Scotch versions up to 5.1.12.
</li>
<li>
Updated Zoltan's hierarchical partitioning for greater efficiency.
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2><a name="Release3.501">Zoltan Release Notes v3.501: May 12, 2011</a></h2>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="REMAP"></a>
<hr>Part Remapping</h4>
During partitioning, Zoltan v1.5 can renumber parts so that the
input and output partitions have greater overlap (and, thus, lower
data-migration costs). This remapping is controlled by Zoltan parameter
<i><a href="ug_alg.html#REMAP">REMAP</a></i>. Experiments have shown
that
using this parameter can greatly reduce data migration costs.
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="KNEP"></a>
<hr>Unequal Numbers of Parts and Processors</h4>
Zoltan v1.5 can be used to generate <i>k</i> parts on <i>p</i>
processors,
where <i>k</i> is not equal to <i>p</i>. Function <a
 href="ug_interface_lb.html#Zoltan_LB_Partition"><b>Zoltan_LB_Partition</b></a>
(replacing <a href="ug_interface_lb.html#Zoltan_LB_Balance"><b>Zoltan_LB_Balance</b></a>)
can generate arbitrary numbers of parts on the given processors.
The number of desired parts is set with parameters <i><a
 href="ug_alg.html#NUM_GLOBAL_PARTS">NUM_GLOBAL_PARTS</a></i>
or <i><a href="ug_alg.html#NUM_LOCAL_PARTS">NUM_LOCAL_PARTS</a></i>.
Both part and processor information are returned by
<a href="ug_interface_lb.html#Zoltan_LB_Partition"><b>Zoltan_LB_Partition</b></a>,
<b><a href="ug_interface_augment.html#Zoltan_LB_Box_PP_Assign">Zoltan_LB_Box_PP_Assign</a></b>,
and
<b><a href="ug_interface_augment.html#Zoltan_LB_Point_PP_Assign">Zoltan_LB_Point_PP_Assign</a></b>.
New Zoltan query functions
<b><a href="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_PART_FN">ZOLTAN_PART_FN</a></b>
and <b><a href="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_PART_MULTI_FN">ZOLTAN_PART_MULTI_FN</a></b>
return objects' part information to Zoltan.
<a href="ug_interface_lb.html#Zoltan_LB_Balance"><b>Zoltan_LB_Balance</b></a>
can still be used for <i>k</i> equal to <i>p</i>.
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="UnequalSizes"></a>
<hr>Non-Uniform Part Sizes</h4>
Part sizes for local and global parts can be specified using
<b><a href="ug_interface_lb.html#Zoltan_LB_Set_Part_Sizes">Zoltan_LB_Set_Part_Sizes</a></b>,
allowing non-uniformly sized parts to be generated by
Zoltan's partitioning algorithms.
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="Interface1.5"></a>
<hr>Zoltan Interface Updated</h4>
To support the concept of parts separate from processors, many new
interface functions were added to Zoltan v1.5 (e.g.,
<a href="ug_interface_lb.html#Zoltan_LB_Partition"><b>Zoltan_LB_Partition</b></a>
and
<b><a href="ug_interface_mig.html#Zoltan_Migrate">Zoltan_Migrate</a></b>).
These functions mimic previous Zoltan functions (e.g.,
<a href="ug_interface_lb.html#Zoltan_LB_Balance"><b>Zoltan_LB_Balance</b></a>
and
<b><a href="ug_interface_mig.html#Zoltan_Help_Migrate">Zoltan_Help_Migrate</a></b>,
respectively), but include both part and processor information.
Both the new and old interface functions work in Zoltan v1.5.
See the notes on <a href="ug_backward.html">Backward Compatibility</a>.
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="HSFCBox"></a>
<hr>Robust HSFC Box Assign</h4>
Function
<b><a href="ug_interface_augment.html#Zoltan_LB_Box_PP_Assign">Zoltan_LB_Box_PP_Assign</a></b>
now works for the <a href="ug_alg_hsfc.html">Hilbert Space-Filling
Curve algorithm (HSFC)</a>,
in addition to the <a href="ug_alg_rcb.html">RCB</a> and <a
 href="ug_alg_rib.html">RIB</a> algorithms supported in previous
versions
of Zoltan. <b><a
 href="ug_interface_augment.html#Zoltan_LB_Point_PP_Assign">Zoltan_LB_Point_PP_Assign</a></b>
continues to work for <a href="ug_alg_hsfc.html">HSFC</a>,
<a href="ug_alg_rcb.html">RCB</a> and <a href="ug_alg_rib.html">RIB</a>.
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="Matrix"></a>
<hr>Matrix Ordering</h4>
Zoltan v1.5 contains a matrix-ordering interface <b><a
 href="ug_interface_order.html#Zoltan_Order">Zoltan_Order</a></b>
to ParMETIS' matrix-ordering
functions. New graph-based matrix-ordering algorithms can be easily
added behind this interface.
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h4><a name="Performance1.5"></a>
<hr>Performance Improvements</h4>
Many performance improvements were added to Zoltan v1.5.
<ul>
  <li>
List-based callback functions have been added to Zoltan
(<b><a href="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_GEOM_MULTI_FN">ZOLTAN_GEOM_MULTI_FN</a></b>,
    <b><a href="ug_query_lb.html#ZOLTAN_PART_MULTI_FN">ZOLTAN_PART_MULTI_FN</a></b>,
    <b><a href="ug_query_mig.html#ZOLTAN_OBJ_SIZE_MULTI_FN">ZOLTAN_OBJ_SIZE_MULTI_FN</a></b>,
    <b><a href="ug_query_mig.html#ZOLTAN_PACK_OBJ_MULTI_FN">ZOLTAN_PACK_OBJ_MULTI_FN</a></b>,
and
    <b><a href="ug_query_mig.html#ZOLTAN_UNPACK_OBJ_MULTI_FN">ZOLTAN_UNPACK_OBJ_MULTI_FN</a></b>);
these functions allow entire lists of data to be passed from the

<h4>More Data Services</h4>
Zoltan's mission has been widened beyond its original focus on dynamic
load-balancing algorithms. Now Zoltan also provides data management
services to parallel, unstructured, and adaptive computations.
Several packages of parallel data services have been added and made
available to
application developers. These services include the following:
<ul>
  <li>An <a href="ug_util_comm.html">unstructured
communication package</a> that simplifies complicated communication by
insulating applications from the details of message
sends and receives.
  </li>
  <li>A <a href="ug_util_dd.html">distributed data directory</a>
that allows applications to efficiently
(in memory and time) locate off-processor data.
  </li>
  <li>A <a href="ug_util_mem.html">dynamic memory
management package</a> that simplifies debugging of
memory allocation problems on state-of-the-art parallel computers.
  </li>
</ul>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<a name="New HSFC"></a>
<hr>
<h4>New Hilbert Space-Filling Curve Partitioning</h4>
Zoltan now includes a fast, efficient implementation of <a
 href="ug_alg_hsfc.html">Hilbert Space-Filling Curve (HSFC)</a>
partitioning. This geometric method also includes
support for <a href="ug_interface_augment.html#Zoltan_LB_Box_Assign">Zoltan_LB_Box_Assign</a>
and <a href="ug_interface_augment.html#Zoltan_LB_Point_Assign">Zoltan_LB_Point_Assign</a>
functions.<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------> <a
 name="New Structured"></a>
<hr>
<h4>Support for Structured-Grid Partitioning</h4>
Zoltan's <a href="ug_alg_rcb.html">Recursive Coordinate Bisection (RCB)</a>
partitioning algorithm has been enhanced to allow
generation of strictly rectilinear subdomains. This capability can be
used for partitioning of grids for structured-grid applications. See
parameter <a href="ug_alg_rcb.html"><i>RCB_RECTILINEAR_BLOCKS</i></a>.
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------><a
 name="ParMETIS3"></a>
<hr>
<h4>Support for ParMETIS v3.0</h4>
In addition to providing interfaces to <a href="ug_alg_parmetis.html">ParMETIS
v2.0</a>,
Zoltan now provides an interfaces <a href="ug_alg_parmetis.html">ParMETIS
v3.0</a>. Full support of ParMETIS v3.0's multiconstraint and
multiobjective partitioning is
included.
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------><a
 name="Performance"></a>
<hr>
<h4>Performance Improvements</h4>
Performance of Zoltan's partitioning algorithms has been improved
through a number of code optimizations and new features. In addition,
user parameter <a href="ug_alg.html#LB%20Parameters"><i>RETURN_LISTS</i></a>
can be used to specify which returned arguments are computed by <a
 href="ug_interface_lb.html#Zoltan_LB_Balance"><b>Zoltan_LB_Balance</b></a>,
allowing reduced work in partitioning.
In the <a href="ug_alg_rcb.html">Recursive Coordinate Bisection (RCB)</a>
partitioning algorithm, user parameters allow cut directions
to be locked in an attempt to minimize data movement; see parameters
<a href="ug_alg_rcb.html"><i>RCB_LOCK_DIRECTIONS</i></a> and <a
 href="ug_alg_rcb.html"><i>RCB_SET_DIRECTIONS</i></a>.

 name="New Interface"></a>
<hr>
<h4>Zoltan Interface Updated</h4>
Zoltan has adopted a more modular design, making it easier to use by
applications and easier to modify by algorithm developers.
Names in the <a href="ug_interface.html">Zoltan interface</a> and code
are tied more closely to their functionality.
Full <a href="ug_backward.html">backward compatibility</a> is
supported
for users of previous versions of Zoltan.
<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------><a
 name="TestSuite"></a>
<hr>
<h4>Improved Test Suite</h4>
The Zoltan <a href="../dev_html/dev_test_script.html">test suite</a>
has been improved, with more tests providing greater
code coverage and platform-specific answer files accounting for
differences
due to computer architectures.
