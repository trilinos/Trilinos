The test directory contains a series of tests used for regression testing.
Each test is in its own directory.  Within each directory, 
  - file README gives a brief description of the particular test.
  - files "zdrive.inp.*" are input files for the zdrive or zfdrive test drivers.
  - subdirectory "answers" contains the accepted solutions for the test.

Test directories ch_* use Chaco-format input files.  These tests may be run
on any number of processors; regression test results are for a specified number
of processors.

Test directories nem_* use Nemesis-format input files.  Running these tests
on arbitrary numbers of processors requires generation of Nemesis parallel
input files; instructions for generating these files are included in the
nem_*/README files.  However, since generating these files is non-trivial, 
it is easiest to run these problems on the specified number of processors.

The script, test_zoltan, in this directory, runs the entire regression test
suite.  See descriptions of test_zoltan in the Zoltan developer's guide.

Test input files zdrive.inp.* have a suffix indicating the particular
partitioning method and parameters used for the test problem.  A summary of
the suffixes is included below:
  - rcb:               RCB method
  - rcb-ts:            RCB method with TFLOPS_SPECIAL parameter.
  - rib:               RIB method
  - rib-ts:            RIB method with TFLOPS_SPECIAL parameter.
  - oct[0,1,2]:        OCTPART method with OCT_METHOD parameter = [0,1,2]
  - partkway:          ParMETIS PartKWay method
  - partgeom:          ParMETIS PartGeom method
  - diffusion:         ParMETIS Diffusion method
  - jostle:            Jostle partitioning method
  - jostle-diffusion:  Jostle partitioning method with jostle_reduction=off
  - *-oneproc:         Initial distribution on only one processor.
  - *-cyclic:          Cyclic initial distribution.

Notes:

2/26/03 KDD
Adaptive-repart method in ParMETIS may give different answers on different
platforms due to differences in qsort between platforms.  On Suns (with
dynamic linking), different versions of the C library may have different
implementations, resulting in different results even across multiple Suns.
(qsort in ParMETIS3.0's SerialRemap function does not have deterministic 
comparison function, so items to be sorted that are equal may be output in 
different order on different platforms; i.e., ties are broken differently.)
