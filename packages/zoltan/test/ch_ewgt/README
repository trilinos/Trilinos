Answers differ for ParMETIS tests on linux platforms 
Suspect difference in rand() is the cause.
On linux, rand() returns values in the range 0 to 2147483647; on
Solaris, it returns values in the range 0 to 32767.  (See definition of
RAND_MAX in <stdlib.h>.)

zdrive.inp.rib-partmore
-  Differences in answers between linux and sun arise due to round off
in computation of xy in Zoltan_RIB_inertial2d on processor two for last
cut (between partitions 3 and 4).  Statement xy += xdif*ydif yields
slightly different results, despite identical input values of xy, xdif, and
ydif.  The resulting cuts are different enough on the two platforms that
node 19 falls on different sides.
