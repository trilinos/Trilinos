"degenerate" is a box of 1000 points with dimensions 9 x 45 x 450.
It is not axis-aligned.

When processed with DEGENERATE_RATIO of 20, this will
be considered to be a 2D geometry (450/9 > 20 but
450/45 < 20).  When processed with DEGENERATE_RATIO of 9, 
it will be treated as 1D (450/9 > 9 and 450/45 > 9).

This geometry can be used to test the REDUCE_DIMENSIONS
parameter on degenerate geometries that are not axis-aligned,
with transformation from 3D to 2D and from 3D to 1D.
