# Zoltan
Zoltan Dynamic Load Balancing and Graph Algorithm Toolkit -- Distribution site

The most up-to-date version of Zoltan is in the Trilinos framework
at https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos.

This site provides stand-alone releases of Zoltan, separate from
Trilinos:  https://github.com/sandialabs/Zoltan/releases.  Stand-alone
releases of Zoltan may lag the Trilinos repo code.

You can download individual releases of Zoltan from this site, or
clone the Trilinos repository https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos
to get the most up-to-date version of Zoltan.  Individual releases
are tarballs that can be unzipped and built with autotools/make.

Trilinos clones include Zoltan in directory Trilinos/packages/zoltan.
In this directory, you can build Zoltan separately from Trilinos
using autotools/make.  Or in the Trilinos repository, you can build
Zoltan using Trilinos' cmake system.
