# Zoltan
Zoltan Dynamic Load Balancing and Graph Algorithm Toolkit -- Distribution site

The most up-to-date version of Zoltan is in the Trilinos framework at https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos.  

This site provides stand-alone releases of Zoltan, separate from Trilinos:  https://github.com/sandialabs/Zoltan/releases.  Stand-alone releases of Zoltan may lag the Trilinos repo code. 

You can download individual releases of Zoltan from this site, or clone the Trilinos repository 
https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos to get the most up-to-date version of Zoltan.  Individual releases are tarballs that can be unzipped and built with autotools/make.  

Trilinos clones include Zoltan in directory Trilinos/packages/zoltan.  In this directory, you can 
build Zoltan separately from Trilinos using autotools/make.  Or in the Trilinos repository, 
you can build Zoltan using Trilinos' cmake system.
