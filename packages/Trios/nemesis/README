========================================================================

NEMESIS is an enhancement to the EXODUSII finite element database
model used to store and retrieve data for unstructured parallel finite
element analyses. NEMESIS adds data structures which facilitate the
partitioning of a scalar (standard serial) EXODUSII file onto parallel
disk systems found on many parallel computers. Since the NEMESIS
application programming interface (API) can be used to append
information to an existing EXODUSII database, any existing software
that reads EXODUSII files can be used on files which contain NEMESIS
information. The NEMESIS information is written and read via C or C++
callable functions which compromise the NEMESIS I API.

The exodusII package is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/exodusii
