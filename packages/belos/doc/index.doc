\mainpage Belos: An Iterative Linear Solvers Package

%Belos is an extensible and interoperable C++ framework for the
numerical solution of large-scale linear systems of equations.  It
provides a collection of iterative linear solver algorithms, which
work for any combination of matrix, preconditioner, and vector types
which make sense together.  

%Belos' is <it>interoperable</it> because it accesses matrices,
preconditioners, and vectors as opaque objects with simple interfaces.
These interfaces do not depend on the internal representation of these
objects.  %Belos' solvers only use matrices and preconditioners as
black-box "operators" that take one or more vectors as input, and
return the same number of vectors as output.  They only access vectors
via a simple interface for adding vectors together or computing their
inner products or norms.

We provide implementations of operator and vector interfaces for
Epetra, Tpetra, and Thyra objects.  As a result, any existing code
employing Epetra, Tpetra, or Thyra operators and vectors (such as
other packages in Trilinos) may also be used in conjunction with
%Belos.  %Belos is <it>extensible</it> because users may define this
interface for their own operators and vectors.  This allows them to
use any %Belos solver with their objects without changing a line of
%Belos code.  Defining this interface requires only a modest effort,
and %Belos provides plenty of examples.  For more details, please
refer to the \ref belos_opvec_interfaces "Belos Operator/Vector
abstract interface".

The \ref belos_solver_framework "Belos linear solver framework"
describes solver managers that provide efficient, convenient, and
powerful computational methods for solving large-scale linear systems
of equations. %Belos' power is a result of the distribution of
functionality across different computational entities in the
framework, including orthogonalization, iterations, stopping criteria,
and restarting methodologies.  %Belos' extensibility comes via the
abstract interfaces describing these entities.  %Belos currently
provides a robust set of options, and users are able to expand this
set to suit specific research and/or application needs.  The ability
to interact directly with these objects provides great flexibility in
computation, while the existence of solver managers allow convenient
programming for standard use cases.

\section solvers Current Linear Solvers 

%Belos provides a framework capable of solving a wide variety of
linear systems of equations.  %Belos can currently solve complex and
real, Hermitian and non-Hermitian, linear problems, via the following
included solvers:

   <ul>
   <li>Single-vector and block GMRES
   <li>Single-vector and block CG
   <li>Pseudo-block variants (perform single-vector algorithms simultaneously):  pseudo-block CG, pseudo-block GMRES
   <li>Recycling solvers:  GCRO-DR and RCG
   <li>Flexible variants:  Flexible GMRES
   </ul>

\section starting_place Where to start

A good place for new users to start is with Belos::SolverFactory.
This factory class lets the user ask for the Belos solver they want by
its string name.  For example, you can ask for "GMRES" or "CG" by name
and the SolverFactory will create that solver, without you needing to
know the name of the corresponding class in Belos.  You may also pass
parameters (via Teuchos::ParameterList) to the solver at this time.
All solvers that SolverFactory creates implement the
Belos::SolverManager interface (which see).

\section belos_browser Browse all of Belos as a single doxygen collection

You can browse all of Belos as a <A HREF="../../browser/doc/html/index.html">single
doxygen collection</A>. Warning, this is not the recommended way to learn
about Belos software.  However, this is a good way to browse the <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/dirs.html">directory structure of belos</a>, to <a
href="../../browser/doc/html/files.html">locate files</a>, etc.

\section belos_thyra Thyra support

The <a href="../../thyra/doc/html/index.html">Belos to Thyra Linear Solver
Adapters</a> take <tt>Thyra::LinearOpBase</tt> objects and turn them into
<tt>Thyra::LinearOpWithSolveBase</tt> objects which can then be used to solve
linear systems using %Belos linear solvers implementations.
