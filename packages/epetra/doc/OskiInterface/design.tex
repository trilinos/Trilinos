In the design and implementation of the Epetra OSKI interface
the Epetra coding guidelines \cite{IK:Epetra-coding}
were followed as closely as possible.  In doing so, we ensured the consistency of 
our code with the existing Epetra code base, as well as its readability and maintainability.
%.  Also, by following the guidelines our 
%code is readable and easy for a future developer to update.  
Finally, the Epetra interface to OSKI
will likely be ported to Kokkos \cite{IK:Kokkos-site}, and the interface's design will make
this process easier.

In the design phase we focused on allowing the greatest amount of flexibility to the user,
and exposing as much of the functionality of OSKI as possible.  In some places, however, OSKI
functionality is not exposed because there is not a corresponding Epetra function.
For example, OSKI has a function that allows changing a 
single value in a matrix, but Epetra does not.  When two copies of a matrix exist, as when the
OSKI constructor makes a deep copy of the underlying data, the corresponding Epetra copy is 
guaranteed to contain the same data.  Since Epetra can only change data values one row at a time,
a point set function is not included in the OSKI interface.  Instead, we include a function
to change a row of data within OSKI by overloading the Epetra function to change row data.  When a
single copy of the data exists, the Epetra function is called on the matrix.
When both an OSKI and Epetra matrix exist, both the matrix copies are modified to keep the data
consistent.  The Epetra function is called once for the Epetra version of the matrix,
and the OSKI matrix has its point function called once for each entry in the row.

When there are clear equivalent functions in OSKI and Epetra, the OSKI function is designed to
overload the Epetra function.  In the cases where OSKI provides more functionality than Epetra, the interface is designed with 
two functions to perform the operation.  The first function mimics Epetra's functionality and passes
values that eliminate the extra functionality from OSKI.  The second function exposes the
full functionality OSKI provides.  Also, as appropriate new functions are added that are
specific to OSKI, such as the tuning functions.  Conversely, Epetra functions without any analogue in the OSKI
context are not overloaded in the \IKcompfont{Epetra\_Oski} namespace.  

The interface is also designed to maintain robustness and ease of use.  All \newline \IKcompfont{Epetra\_OskiMatrix}
functions that take in vectors or multi-vectors allow for the input of both \IKcompfont{Epetra\_Vector} or 
\IKcompfont{Epetra\_MultiVector} objects, and \IKcompfont{Epetra\_OskiVector} or \IKcompfont{Epetra\_OskiMultiVector}
objects.  The objects are converted to the proper types as necessary through the
use of the lightest weight wrapper or converter possible.

The implementation follows the idea of wrapping and converting data structures in as lightweight
a fashion as possible, to maximize speed and minimize space used.  In addition, the implementation
provides the user with as much flexibility as possible.  For example,
the user can specify as many tuning hints as they like.  Alternatively, the user can ask Epetra
to figure out as much as it can about the matrix and pass along those hints to OSKI.  Both options can be combined,
with user-specified hints taking precedence over automatically generated hints.
Options are passed by the user via Teuchos parameter lists \cite{IK:Teuchos-site}.

Finally, the design is broken into six separate classes.
Table \ref{IK:fig:oskiclasses} shows the classes and provides information about which classes each
derives from, and what functions each contains.  The design is as modular as possible to allow
for the easy addition of new functions, and to logically group related functions together.

%An example of how to use \IKcompfont{Epetra\_Oski} functions is shown below within a conjugate gradient algorithm.

%\begin{verbatim}

%Epetra_OskiVector Jacobi_UsingOski(Epetra_Matrix& A, Epetra_Vector& x, Epetra_Vector& b) {

%  double alpha;
%  int i, j, k;
%  Epetra_Vector x0(A.RowMap); 
%  x0.PutScalar(0.0);

%  Epetra_OskiUtils object;
%  object.Init();
%  Epetra_OskiMatrix AMat(A);
%  Epetra_OskiVector xVec(x);
%  Epetra_OskiVector bVec(b);
  
  


%\end{verbatim}

%In figure \ref{something} the matrix-vector multiply from OSKI is used along with OSKI's tuning functionality.


%The functions implimented were 

%\subsection{Classes}

%Classes needed are:

%\begin{itemize}

%\item Matrix: For all matrix data and calculations involving the matrix.  Functionality
%      includes tuning, multiplies and get/set methods.

%\item Vector: For storing vector objects.  This is a light-weight wrapper.

%\item MultiVector: For storing multi-vector objects.  This is a light-weight wrapper.

%\item Permutation: For storing the permutations performed on a matrix.  The class allows 
%      the permutations to be applied to vectors and multi-vectors.

%\item Utils: For error handling and init/close functions.

%\end{itemize}

%Right now when a class inherets from another class the copy constructor of the inheretected class is
%called.  We may want to change this at a later point for efficency but to get the code working this
%decision is fine as it makes things easier to deal with.

%\subsection{Kernels}

%Operations should default to the matrix type of Epetra or OSKI when both are valid
%and all other data types are of the same design.  Usage could occur in many mixed forms
%and possible ways to handle them are listed below.

%\begin{itemize}

%\item The simplest but least robust is to not allow mixed types of OSKI and Epetra matrices 
%in the same function call.

%\item When mixed types occur use the matrix type as the calculation type and convert vectors
%appropriately for both input and output.

%\item Use the above idea but also allow a way to override through an optional parameter.

%\item Default to the lowest denominator of Epetra unless overridden.

%\end{itemize}

%As of 5/27/2008 the way this is being handled is there are two multiply functions one for
%vectors and one for multi-vectors.  Each function must take in a transpose argument and
%two vector arguments.  It has default alpha and beta values that can be overridden if 
%desired.  The vectors passed in can be either \IKcompfont{Epetra\_Vector} or \IKcompfont{Epetra\_OskiVector} in 
%type, however, the only type in the function header will be Epetra\_Vector.  The 
%previous design decision necessitates the following treatment of passed in parameters.
%Under the hood \IKcompfont{Epetra\_Vector} objects will be converted to \IKcompfont{Epetra\_OskiVector}
%objects and back to \IKcompfont{Epetra\_Vector} objects as needed.  \IKcompfont{Epetra\_OskiVector} objects will 
%either by dynamically cast back to an \IKcompfont{Epetra\_OskiVector} or converted to an \IKcompfont{Epetra\_OskiVector}
%whichever method of conversion is deemed more efficient.

%\subsection{Tuning}

%The entire OSKI tuning interface should be available to the user.  In order to make
%the entire tuning interface avalible parameter lists are needed.  Parameter lists are
%needed for the generic set hint function and hints for a specific operation.  The lists
%are nessacitated as OSKI uses predefined functions and it is easier to use parameter
%lists to account for these constants than having the user and programmer redefine 
%constants in the \IKcompfont{Epetra\_OskiMatrix} class.

%Extra capabilities could be added to the interface through the use of 
%data stored in the Epetra matrix and through tuning every x multiplies.

%\subsection{Replace/Extract methods}

%OSKI only has a get/set value and get/set diagonal function.  Epetra has only a get/set
%row and get/set diagonal function.  In addition, the Epetra get and set diagonal functions
%are less robust than the OSKI ones.  To be consistent and to keep the data consistent in
%two copies of the matrix that could be present after \IKcompfont{Oski\_Tune()} has been 
%called the following decisions have been made.

%\begin{itemize}

%\item The Oski get/set diagonal functions are decreased in functionality to the same
%level as the Epetra ones.

%\item There is no ability to get/set a single element from Oski.

%\item When a row is wanted to be retrieved of set and there are two copies of the matrix 
%the Oski point get/set are looped over.  The user is warned that this operation could
%be slow.

%\end{itemize}

%\subsection{Error Handling}

%We may need to have a light-weight wrapper to interpret OSKI error codes.  Error
%handling should also be done in a way such that if multiple processors are throwing 
%the same code then the message is displayed as few times as possible and preferably just
%once.
