Overall, OSKI can produce large speedups in sparse matrix computational kernels.  This is especially
true
when the matrix is block structured or multiple multiplications are performed
using the same matrix.  In some cases it can also produce large gains for matrix-vector
multiplies involving only a single matrix.  However, OSKI is still
missing some features, such as a multi-vector kernel and the ability to tune
matrices to make them symmetric. Both could produce large runtime gains.  Our Epetra/OSKI
interface has stubs to allow the use of these missing features as soon as they become available in
OSKI.  Our experiments show that Sandia applications that make heavy use certain sparse matrix kernels
can benefit from the current version of OSKI.  As new OSKI features 
become available, its potential impact on other Sandia applications should increase.
