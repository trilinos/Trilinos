SUMMARY

This test driver builds a sparse matrix with 25 non-zeros per row (on average) with the specified local grid dimensions.
It then tests the performance of:
- sparse matrix-vector multiplication, 
- sparse matrix-multivector multiplication for 2, 4, 8 RHS,
- vector 2-norm (for a vector of the same global dimension as the sparse matrix)
- vector dot product
- vector axpy (y = alpha*x + y)

Run the command without any arguments to see the usage of the executable.

HOW TO BUILD

1) Download Trilinos from http://trilinos.sandia.gov

2) Install Trilinos as follows:

- Untar the source code.
- Create a directory called EPETRA_MPI_OPT under the main trilinos directory
- Create a file called "invoke-configure" in the EPETRA_MPI_OPT directory and insert the following 
  configure invocation command (or something very similar, depending on compilers, etc.):

../configure -C \
CXXFLAGS=-O3 \
CFLAGS=-O3 \
FFLAGS="-O5 -funroll-all-loops" \
--prefix=/home/mheroux/trilinos-7.0.9/EPETRA_OPT \
--enable-mpi \
--with-mpi-compilers \
--disable-default-packages \
--disable-tests \
--disable-examples \
--enable-epetra \
--with-gnumake

- Invoke this command (by sourcing the file invoke-configure).
  NOTE:  You will need a valid installation of BLAS and LAPACK.  See the Trilinos installation guide for details
         (at the Trilinos website).

- Once you successfully configure Trilinos, type "make; make install"


3) While in the EPETRA_MPI_OPT directory, untar the gzipped tar file that contains this README file.
   This should create a directory called epetratest.

4) Type "make" in the epetratest directory.  This should build an executable called cxx_main.exe.

5) Run the executable.  The file "go" in the epetratest directory gives an example of how to run the executable
   multiple times to get a series of timing information.
