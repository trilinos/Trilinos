\brief Different ways to add entries to Epetra sparse matrix

\section Epetra_Lesson04_Topics Lesson topics

This lesson explains how to add entries to a Epetra sparse matrix
(Epetra_CrsMatrix).  It explains how you can choose any of various
ways to add entries to the matrix.  Some are more flexible but less
efficient, and others are more efficient but less flexible.  In
general, knowing the sparse matrix structure in advance will reduce
both peak memory usage and total run time.

This lesson does not currently include code examples.  The section
\ref Epetra_Lesson04_Exercise at the end suggests modifying the
example \ref Epetra_Lesson03 in order to learn about the different
ways to add or change the entries of a sparse matrix.

\section Epetra_Lesson04_Fill Filling a sparse matrix

We call adding entries to a sparse matrix <i>filling</i> it, and call
the general procedure "sparse matrix fill" or just <i>fill</i>.  Often
people have finite element assembly in mind when they use this
expression, but fill here means adding entries for any reason.  For
example, you might want to
<ul>
<li> solve an optimization problem with a set of linear constraints,
so you would add one row to the sparse matrix for each constraint; or
</li>
<li> represent a weighted graph as a sparse matrix, so that each row
of the matrix represents a vertex's adjacency list and corresponding
edge weights. </li>
</ul>
Also, by extension, "fill" might refer to modifying existing entries
of a sparse matrix.

\section Epetra_Lesson04_Rowwise Rowwise access, not rowwise distribution

Epetra_CrsMatrix inherits from the Epetra_RowMatrix interface; it "is
a" RowMatrix.  Some people have the misconception that "RowMatrix"
(and therefore CrsMatrix) refers to a rowwise distribution of the
sparse matrix over parallel processes.  It does not.  CrsMatrix
supports an arbitrary "two-dimensional" distribution of rows and
columns over processes.  The term instead refers to rowwise access to
the data.  That is, the methods in this interface and in CrsMatrix let
you add or access entries on each process by row.

This distinction matters because two or more processes might share
entries in a row.  Asking for "all the entries in a row" on a
particular process only accesses the entries owned by that process,
which is not necessarily all the entries in a row.

Whether adding entries or modifying existing ones, you may always do
so for any number of entries in the row, such that their columns are
owned by the calling process.  You should always modify as many
entries with one method call as possible, in order to amortize
function call and data access overhead.

\section Epetra_Lesson04_Phases Phases of fill

An Epetra_CrsMatrix may be in either of two different states:
<ol>
<li> Post construction, before user calls \c FillComplete() </li>
<li> After user calls \c FillComplete() </li>
</ol>

In both states, you are allowed to set or modify values in the matrix.
In State 1, if the matrix was not created with a constant graph (see
below), and if there is room in the row (see "static profile"
discussion below), you are allowed to change the graph structure of
the matrix by inserting entries.

We call a matrix in State 2 "fill complete."  In State 2, you are
<i>not</i> allowed to modify the graph structure of the matrix, but
you <i>are</i> allowed to modify the values in the matrix.

Calling \c FillComplete() does a lot of work.  In general, it requires
distributed-memory communication as well as local rearrangement of
data.  The intent is that you should exploit this work for as long as
possible before creating a new matrix with a different graph
structure.  You can do so by performing multiple sparse matrix-vector
multiplies or triangular solves.

\section Epetra_Lesson04_Tradeoffs Trade-offs between flexibility and performance

\subsection Epetra_Lesson04_Tradeoffs_dyn_no_hint The most general case: dynamic allocation, no size hint

CrsMatrix lets you make trade-offs between flexibility and
performance.  All of these trade-offs revolve around how much you know
about the structure of the sparse matrix -- that is, its graph -- in
advance.  In the most general case, all you know is which process owns
which row -- the row Map.
\code
Epetra_Map rowMap (...); // whatever row Map you want
Epetra_CrsMatrix A (Copy, rowMap, 0);
\endcode
This code snippet says that you want to create a sparse matrix with
the given row distribution.  It also says that you intend each process
to own all the entries in a given row.  If you want to allow a more
general "2-D" distribution, you must also tell the constructor which
process owns which columns of the matrix.  You do so by supplying a
"column Map":
\code
Epetra_Map rowMap (...); // whatever row Map you want
Epetra_Map colMap (...); // whatever column Map you want
Epetra_CrsMatrix A (Copy, rowMap, colMap, 0);
\endcode
All the examples that follow allow you to supply a column Map if you
which, so we omit this for brevity.

Both of these ways to create a sparse matrix allocate memory for the
entries in each row dynamically.  This means that it reallocates space
as necessary.  We call this <i>dynamic profile</i>, where "profile"
refers to the structure (the graph) of the sparse matrix.  (<i>Static
profile</i>, which we describe later, does not reallocate; it fixes an
upper bound on the number of entries allowed per row.)  CrsMatrix
implements this currently as an array of arrays, one array per row,
though this may change.  You might hear this array of arrays structure
referred to as "2-D storage," versus the "1-D" storage of the
conventional compressed sparse row format.

\section Epetra_Lesson04_Tradeoffs_dyn_hint Dynamic allocation with a size hint

In the above examples, the matrix has no information about how many
entries you want to add to each row.  Thus, it has to make some
default assumption.  The "size hint" defaults to zero, to ensure that
empty or nearly empty sparse matrices take as little memory as
possible.  An initial reservation of zero entries per row may cause
frequent reallocation if you add entries to a row many times.
Reallocation takes time, because it requires talking to the C++
run-time library or the system library.  It also tends to fragment
memory and thus disturb locality, further reducing performance.

If you have a pretty good idea how many entries will be in each row,
you may give a "size hint" to the constructor.  You may do so either
with a single number, which is an expected upper bound on the number
of entries in any one row, or with an upper bound for each row of the
matrix.  The typical use case is a single upper bound, which we
illustrate below.
\code
Epetra_Map rowMap (...); // whatever row Map you want
// With dynamic profile, this is only a hint, not a hard constraint.
const int maxEntriesPerRow = 3;
Epetra_CrsMatrix A (Copy, rowMap, maxEntriesPerRow);
\endcode
If you have an upper bound for each row, you probably could use static
profile, but it is still legal to use dynamic profile in this case.

Giving an upper bound on the number of entries per row allows the
matrix to preallocate space for each row.  Dynamic profile still
allows you to put more entries in a row than that, but if you don't,
then the matrix will only allocate space once per row during the fill
phase.

\section Epetra_Lesson04_Tradeoffs_static Static allocation

Static allocation, what we call <i>static profile</i>, means that the
"size hint" becomes a hard constraint.  You may either specify a
single upper bound on the number of entries in any row, or an array
with a separate upper bound for each row.  Here is an example of the
former:
\code
// With static profile, this is a hard constraint.
const int maxEntriesPerRow = 3;
const bool staticProfile = true;
Epetra_CrsMatrix A (Copy, rowMap, maxEntriesPerRow, staticProfile);
\endcode
What happens when you specify static profile is that the matrix
allocates "1-D" storage.  That is, rather than the aforementioned
"2-D" array of arrays, the matrix allocates the usual three compressed
sparse row arrays (ptr, ind, val), with fixed space in each row (given
either by the upper bound, or by the aforementioned array).  When
you're done filling and call \c FillComplete(), this means the matrix
need only "pack" the 1-D storage into its final representation by
copying the entries that you filled in (and not any of the "slack
space" you might have left).  Static profile also may use less memory
than dynamic profile, because you don't have to store a complicated
dynamic data structure for each row of the matrix.

\section Epetra_Lesson04_Tradeoffs_const_graph Constant graph

The most efficient but least flexible fill method is to create the
Epetra_CrsMatrix with a constant graph.  That is, you create a
Epetra_CrsGraph separately, fill it, call its \c FillComplete()
method, then pass the graph to the Epetra_CrsMatrix constructor.  This
completely constrains the structure of the CrsMatrix.  You may only
set or modify values in the matrix, not the structure.  (This means
you may not call <tt>InsertGlobalValues()</tt> or
<tt>InsertMyValues()</tt>, only the <tt>Replace*Values()</tt>,
<tt>SumInto*Values</tt>, <tt>Scale()</tt>, and <tt>PutScalar()</tt>
methods.

\code
// Note that the CrsMatrix constructor takes a "const" graph.
// This means that the CrsMatrix is not allowed to change the
// graph.  You shouldn't either.  The graph must be fill complete.
Epetra_CrsGraph graph (...);

// The graph comes with the row and column Maps already built in.
// CrsMatrix's constructor takes the graph by "value," but this 
// does a shallow copy; it does not copy the entries in the graph.
Epetra_CrsMatrix A (Copy, graph);
\endcode
Filling the CrsGraph works much like filling a CrsMatrix, except that
you only specify structure, not values.  Furthermore, the same size
hint and dynamic profile vs. static profile options apply to CrsGraph.

\section Epetra_Lesson04_local_vs_global Local vs. global indices

Please see \ref Epetra_Lesson02 for a detailed explanation of global
and local indices.

In the sparse matrix's final state, it represents column indices as
local indices.  This is faster for operations like sparse
matrix-vector multiply.  It saves storage as well, especially if
Epetra was configured to use 64-bit global indices.  However,
accessing or inserting entries by local index is only allowed under
certain conditions.  In particular, the matrix must have a column Map,
which tells it how to convert between global and local indices for the
column indices of the matrix.  If you didn't create the matrix with a
precomputed column Map (either in its constructor, or in the constant
graph), it has to compute the column Map on its own.  It does so in
<tt>FillComplete()</tt>.

If the matrix doesn't have a column Map yet, you must use global
indices, since local indices don't exist yet.  However, if you can use
local indices, you should.  For global indices, the matrix must go to
the Map to look up the corresponding local index for every global
index.  Local indices only require an array access.

Remember that if column indices are local, then they are counted with
respect to the column Map.  Local row and column indices may not
necessarily be the same.  For example, the matrix entry at position
<tt>(i_local, i_local)</tt>, where the first \c i_local is the local
row index and the second \c i_local the local column index, may not
necessarily be a diagonal entry of the matrix.  However, the matrix
entry at global position <tt>(i_global, i_global)</tt> is always a
diagonal entry of the matrix.

\section Epetra_Lesson04_Exercise Exercise

Start with the \ref Epetra_Lesson03 example, which uses a dynamic
profile and global indices.  Try all of the different fill techniques
described in this lesson.  If you like, you may also try cyclic
boundary conditions instead of Dirichlet boundary conditions in the
1-D Poisson discretization.  (This makes the number of entries per row
the same for all rows.)
