//! Epetra_Data:  The Epetra Base Data Class.
/*! The Epetra_Data class is a base class for all Epetra Data Classes.
	  It provides a mechanism so that one data object can be shared by multiple
		class instances. However, it is meant only to be used internally by
		another Epetra class. It does not provide smart pointer like capabilities.
		Incrementing and decrementing the reference count, and deleting the
		data class instance (if necessary), are duties of the Epetra class
		utilizing Epetra_Data.

		All of Epetra_Data's methods are protected. This is because Epetra_Data
		should never be used directly. Rather, a class that derives from
		Epetra_Data should be used instead. For example, Epetra_MpiCommData or
		Epetra_BlockMapData.

		DEVELOPER NOTES:
		(1) Any class that inherits from Epetra_Data may need to define an
		assignment operator, if it adds pointers. Epetra_Data doesn't have any,
		and so the default (compiler-generated) assignment operator is good enough.
		(2) The behavior of a derived class is left up to the
		implementer(s) of that class. As such, it cannot be assumed that
		just because a class inherits from Epetra_Data, that it supports copy
		construction or assignment, or that it will perform as expected.
