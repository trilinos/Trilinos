//! Epetra_Distributor:  The Epetra Gather/Scatter Setup Base Class.
/*! The Epetra_Distributor class is an interface that encapsulates the general
  information and services needed for other Epetra classes to perform gather/scatter
  operations on a parallel computer.
  An Epetra_Distributor object is actually produced by calling a method in the Epetra_Comm class.

  Epetra_Distributor has default implementations, via Epetra_SerialDistributor and
  Epetra_MpiDistributor, for both serial execution and MPI
  distributed memory execution.  It is meant to insulate the user from
  the specifics of communication that are not required for normal
  manipulation of linear algebra objects..
