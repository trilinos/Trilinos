//! Epetra_CrsSingletonFilter: A class for explicitly eliminating matrix rows and columns.

/*! The Epetra_CrsSingletonFilter class takes an existing Epetra_LinearProblem object, analyzes
    it structure and explicitly eliminates singleton rows and columns from the matrix and appropriately
    modifies the RHS and LHS of the linear problem.  The result of this process is a reduced system of equations
    that is itself an Epetra_LinearProblem object.  The reduced system can then be solved using any solver that
    is understands an Epetra_LinearProblem.  The solution for the full system is obtained by calling ComputeFullSolution().

    Singleton rows are defined to be rows that have a single nonzero entry in the matrix.  The equation associated with
    this row can be explicitly eliminated because it involved only one variable.  For example if row i has a single nonzero
    value in column j, call it A(i,j), we can explicitly solve for x(j) = b(i)/A(i,j), where b(i) is the ith entry of the RHS
    and x(j) is the jth entry of the LHS.

    Singleton columns are defined to be columns that have a single nonzero entry in the matrix.  The variable associated
    with this column is fully dependent, meaning that the solution for all other variables does not depend on it.  If this
    entry is A(i,j) then the ith row and jth column can be removed from the system and x(j) can be solved after the solution
    for all other variables is determined.

    By removing singleton rows and columns, we can often produce a reduced system that is smaller and far less dense, and in
    general having better numerical properties.

    The basic procedure for using this class is as follows:
<ol>
<li> Construct full problem: Construct and Epetra_LinearProblem containing the "full" matrix, RHS and LHS.  This is
     done outside of Epetra_CrsSingletonFilter class.
     Presumably, you have some reason to believe that this system may contain singletons.
<li> Construct an Epetra_CrsSingletonFilter instance:  Constructor needs no arguments.
<li> Analyze matrix: Invoke the Analyze() method, passing in the Epetra_RowMatrix object from your full linear
     problem mentioned in the first step above.
<li> Go/No Go decision to construct reduced problem:
     Query the results of the Analyze method using the SingletonsDetected() method.  This method
     returns "true" if there were singletons found in the matrix.  You can also query any of the other methods
     in the Filter Statistics section to determine if you want to proceed with the construction of the reduced system.
<li> Construct reduced problem:
     If, in the previous step, you determine that you want to proceed with the construction of the reduced problem,
     you should next call the ConstructReducedProblem() method, passing in the full linear problem object from the first
     step.  This method will use the information from the Analyze() method to construct a reduce problem that has
     explicitly eliminated the singleton rows, solved for the corresponding LHS values and updated the RHS.  This
     step will also remove singleton columns from the reduced system.  Once the solution of the reduced problem is
     is computed (via any solver that understands an Epetra_LinearProblem), you should call the ComputeFullSolution()
     method to compute the LHS values assocaited with the singleton columns.
<li> Solve reduced problem: Obtain a pointer to the reduced problem using the ReducedProblem() method.
     Using the solver of your choice, solve the reduced system.
<li> Compute solution to full problem:  Once the solution the reduced problem is determined, the ComputeFullSolution()
     method will place the reduced solution values into the appropriate locations of the full solution LHS and then
     compute the values associated with column singletons.  At this point, you have a complete solution to the original
     full problem.
<li> Solve a subsequent full problem that differs from the original problem only in values: It is often the case that the
     structure of a problem will be the same for a sequence of linear problems.  In this case, the UpdateReducedProblem()
     method can be useful.  After going through the above process one time, if you have a linear problem that is structural
     \e identical to the previous problem, you can minimize memory and time costs by using the UpdateReducedProblem()
     method, passing in the subsequent problem.  Once you have called the UpdateReducedProblem() method, you can then
     solve the reduce problem problem as you wish, and then compute the full solution as before.  The pointer generated
     by ReducedProblem() will not change when UpdateReducedProblem() is called.
