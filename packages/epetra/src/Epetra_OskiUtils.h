/*! The Epetra_OskiUtils class is a helper class used to call OSKI functions that do not use matrix, vector, error or permutation objects.
	  It provides an interface to access the initialization and finalize routines of OSKI.

		All functions are public to allow access to methods needed by programs using OSKI.
		There are no data members of the class as all data is kept in the matrix, vector,
		multi-vector, error and permutation classes.
