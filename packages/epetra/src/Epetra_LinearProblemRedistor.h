  /*! Constructs a new Epetra_LinearProblem that is a copy of the one passed in to the constructor.
		  The new problem will have redistributed copies of the RowMatrix, LHS and RHS from the original
			problem.  If any of these three objects are 0 pointers, then the corresponding pointer will be
			zero in the redistributed object.

			The redistributed matrix will constructed as an Epetra_CrsMatrix.  The LHS and RHS will be Epetra_MultiVector
			objects.

			Two bools can be set when calling this method.  The first,
			ConstructTranspose, will cause the Redistribute method to construct the transpose of the original
			row matrix.  The second, MakeDataContiguous, forces the memory layout of the output matrix, RHS and LHS
			to be stored so that it is compatible with Fortran.  In particular, the Epetra_CrsMatrix is stored so
			that value from row to row are contiguous, as are the indices.  This is compatible with the Harwell-Boeing
			compressed row and compressed column format.  The RHS and LHS are created so that there is a constant stride between
			the columns of the multivector.  This is compatible with Fortran 2D array storage.

    \param ConstructTranspose (In) Causes the output matrix to be transposed.  This feature can be used
		       to support solvers that need the matrix to be stored in column format.  This option
					 has no impact on the LHS and RHS of the output problem.
		\param MakeDataContiguous (In) Causes the output matrix, LHS and RHS to be stored in a form compatible with
		       Fortran-style solvers.  The output matrix will be compatible with the Harwell-Boeing compressed
					 column format.  The RHS and LHS will be stored such that the last value in column j of the
					 multivector is stored next to the first value in column j+1.
		\param RedistProblem (Out) The redistributed Epetra_LinearProblem.  The RowMatrix, LHS and RHS that are generated
		       as part of this problem will be destroyed when the Epetra_LinearProblemRedistor object is destroyed.

		\return Integer error code, 0 if no errors, positive value if one or more of the
		        LHS or RHS pointers were 0.  Negative if some other fatal error occured.
