//! Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix: A class for constructing and using symmetric positive definite dense matrices.

/*! The Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix class enables the construction and use of
    real-valued, symmetric positive definite,
    double-precision dense matrices.  It is built on the Epetra_SerialDenseMatrix class which
    in turn is built on the
    BLAS via the Epetra_BLAS class.

The Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix class is intended to provide full-featured support for solving
linear and eigen system
problems for symmetric positive definite matrices.  It is written on top of BLAS and LAPACK
and thus has excellent
performance and numerical capabilities.  Using this class, one can either perform simple
factorizations and solves or
apply all the tricks available in LAPACK to get the best possible solution for very
ill-conditioned problems.

<b>Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix vs. Epetra_LAPACK</b>

The Epetra_LAPACK class provides access to most of the same functionality as
Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix.
The primary difference is that Epetra_LAPACK is a "thin" layer on top of
LAPACK and Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix
attempts to provide easy access to the more sophisticated aspects of
solving dense linear and eigensystems.
<ul>
<li> When you should use Epetra_LAPACK:  If you are simply looking for a
     convenient wrapper around the Fortran LAPACK
     routines and you have a well-conditioned problem, you should probably use Epetra_LAPACK directly.
<li> When you should use Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix: If you want to (or potentially want to)
     solve ill-conditioned
     problems or want to work with a more object-oriented interface, you should
     probably use Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix.

</ul>

<b>Constructing Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix Objects</b>

There are three Epetra_DenseMatrix constructors.  The first constructs a zero-sized object
which should be made
to appropriate length using the Shape() or Reshape() functions and then filled with
the [] or () operators.
The second is a constructor that accepts user
data as a 2D array, the third is a copy constructor. The second constructor has
two data access modes (specified by the Epetra_DataAccess argument):
<ol>
  <li> Copy mode - Allocates memory and makes a copy of the user-provided data. In this case, the
       user data is not needed after construction.
  <li> View mode - Creates a "view" of the user data. In this case, the
       user data is required to remain intact for the life of the object.
</ol>

\warning View mode is \e extremely dangerous from a data hiding perspective.
Therefore, we strongly encourage users to develop code using Copy mode first and
only use the View mode in a secondary optimization phase.

<b>Extracting Data from Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix Objects</b>

Once a Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix is constructed, it is possible to view the data via access functions.

\warning Use of these access functions cam be \e extremely dangerous from a data hiding perspective.


<b>Vector and Utility Functions</b>

Once a Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix is constructed, several mathematical functions can be applied to
the object.  Specifically:
<ul>
  <li> Multiplication.
  <li> Norms.
</ul>

<b>Counting floating point operations </b>
The Epetra_SerialSymDenseMatrix class has Epetra_CompObject as a base class.  Thus, floating
point operations
are counted and accumulated in the Epetra_Flop object (if any) that was set using the SetFlopCounter()
method in the Epetra_CompObject base class.
