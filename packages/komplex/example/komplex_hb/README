This directory contains two test routines.  

NOTE: You must follow the instructions in the files INSTALL and 
      komplex_INSTALL before trying to compile the test routines.


Test routine #1
---------------

The first test routine is simple.c.  This file constructs an artificial 
complex linear system that is guaranteed to converge in 20 iterations, 
independent of problem size or number of processors used.  To build the 
executable "simple", type:

make simple

or (on SGIs and other machines with bad make utilities) type:

gmake simple


Test routine #2
---------------

The second test routine is in main.c.  This test routine exercises a
variety of komplex options and solves a complex system that is
contained in two Harwell-Boeing data files.  Depending on compile options, 
the make command builds one of four different executables:

az_komplex_serial_msr - Serial execution using MSR data structure
az_komplex_mpi_msr    - Parallel execution using MSR data structure
az_komplex_serial_msr - Serial execution using VBR data structure
az_komplex_mpi_msr    - Parallel execution using VBR data structure

The MSR executables requires four arguments.

Argument 1: Type of system to convert to komplex formulation: 

  c2k -  Test program constructs a complex problem and calls
         appropriate komplex routines to solve it.

 ri2k -  Test program constructs a real/imaginary problem and calls
         appropriate komplex routines to solve it.

  g2k -  Test program constructs a general problem and calls
         appropriate komplex routines to solve it.

Argument 2: Type of indices:

  global - Construct input matrices using global index space.  The
           index values in bindx (the Aztec MSR/VBR index vector) refer to the
           global indexing of the matrix, not a tranformed index space used on
           each processor.  Global indices are what the user typically uses to 
           construct their problem.
  local  - Construct input matrices using local index space.  The
           index values in bindx (the Aztec MSR/VBR index vector) refer to the 
           local indexing of the matrix, typically the local index values are
           obtained by calling AZ_transform.

Argument 3: File name of a Harwell-Boeing format file containing the
            first matrix structure and values.  The exact use of this
            matrix will depend on the choice of Argument 1.

Argument 4: File name of a Harwell-Boeing format file containing the
            second matrix structure and values.The exact use of this
            matrix will depend on the choice of Argument 1.


The VBR executables require an additional argument.

Argument 5: The block size to use for partitioning the input matrices
            into variable block matrices.

To make the executables:

1) Use the set_makefiles and set_komplex_makefiles commands to select
   the target machine and communication mode.

2) Make Aztec and Komplex by going to the lib and komplex_lib
   directories and typing "make".

3) Make the test executable by going to the komplex_app directory
(here) and typing (you may need to use gmake instead of make):
  make FORMAT=MSR - to get the MSR version.
  make FORMAT=VBR - to get the VBR version.

Note that the communication option for the test executable has already
been selected by Step 1.
