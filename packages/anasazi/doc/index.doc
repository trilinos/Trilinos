   \mainpage Anasazi: A Block Eigensolvers Package

   \section intro Introduction

%Anasazi is a powerful, extensible and interoperable C++ framework for the
numerical solution of large-scale eigenvalue problems. The motivation for this
framework is to provide a generic interface to a collection of algorithms for
solving large-scale eigenvalue problems. %Anasazi's interoperability results
from its understanding of operators and vectors as opaque objects---these
objects are accessed only via elementary operations. Hence the user has the
flexibility to specify the data representation for operators and vectors and
may so leverage any existing software investment. This mechanism is
accomplished via the \ref anasazi_opvec_interfaces "Anasazi Operator/Vector abstract interface". 
Current interfaces available include Thyra, Epetra and Tpetra. As a result, any
existing code employing Thyra, Epetra or Tpetra operators and vectors (such as other
packages in Trilinos) may also be used in conjunction with %Anasazi.

The \ref anasazi_solver_framework "Anasazi eigensolver framework" describes
eigensolver and eigensolver managers that provide efficient, convenient and
powerful computational methods. %Anasazi's power is a result of the
distribution of functionality across different computational entities in the
framework: orthogonalization, sorting/selection, eigenvalue iterations,
restarting methodologies, etc. 
%Anasazi's extensibility comes via 
the abstract interfaces describing these entities. %Anasazi currently provides
a robust set of options, and users are able to expand this set to suit specific 
research and/or application needs.
The ability to interact directly with
these objects provides great flexibility in computation, while the existence of
solver managers allow convenient programming for standard use cases.

   \section solvers Current Eigensolvers

Unlike <a href="http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/">ARPACK</a>, which provides a single eigensolver, %Anasazi provides a framework capable of describing a wide variety of eigenproblems and algorithms for solving them. %Anasazi can currently solve complex and real, Hermitian and non-Hermitian, eigenvalue problems, via the following included methods:

   <ul>
   <li>Block Krylov-Schur method, a block extension of <em>A Krylov-Schur Algorithm for
   Large Eigenproblems</em>, G. W. Stewart, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 23, pp. 601-614 (2000).
   <li>Block Davidson method described in <em>A Comparison of Eigensolvers for Large-scale 3D Modal Analysis Using AMG-Preconditioned Iterative Methods</em>, P. Arbenz, U. L. Hetmaniuk, R. B. Lehoucq, R. S. Tuminaro, Internat. J. for Numer. Methods Engrg., 64, pp. 204-236 (2005)
   <li>LOBPCG, a stable implementation of <em>Toward  the optimal preconditioned
   eigensolver: Locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient method</em>, SIAM
   J. Sci. Comput., 23 (2001), pp. 517-541, as described in <em>Basis selection in
   LOBPCG</em>, U. L. Hetmaniuk and R. B. Lehoucq, J. Comput. Physics, 218, pp. 324-332 (2006)
   <li>IRTR, an implicit version of the Riemannian Trust-Region Eigensolver, orginally described in 
   <em>A truncated-CG style method for symmetric generalized eigenvalue problems</em>, P.-A. Absil, C. G. Baker, and K. A. Gallivan, J. Computational and Applied Mathematics, 189, pp. 274-285 (2006).
   <li>Generalized Davidson method, a non-symmetric variant of the block Davidson solver described above. This solver is <em>experimental</em>, but is currently in active use. It currently only support real-valued scalar types.
