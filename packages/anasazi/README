CURRENT STATUS OF ANASAZI
--------------------------------------------

NOTE:  	HTML Documentation for Anasazi can be created through doxygen using the Doxyfile configuration file  
	in the "doc" directory (command:  make -f classicMakefile).  LaTEX documentation for the modal analysis 
	solvers can be created using the userGuide.tex file and pdflatex in the "doc" directory 
	(command:  make -f classicMakefile userGuide).

Source files (found in anasazi/src):
-----------------------------
AnasaziBlockArnoldi.hpp	
	(block Arnoldi solver) 
	This solver can compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a nonsymmetric or symmetric operator.
	An explicit restarting technique has been implemented.  Debugging routines have been 
	implemented to track the convergence of requested eigenvalues and validity of the orthogonal basis.  
	The parameters will be discussed below, the default arguments of the constructor are in parentheses.  
	This method is written using templates, so TYPE refers to the template argument <TYPE> which
	is the floating-point precision used during the calculations.
	
	Parameters:
		tol	- (TYPE) residual tolerance for the computed eigenvalues. (1.0e-6)
		nev	- (int) number of eigenvalues requested. (5)
		length	- (int) length of factorization. Since this is a block method, the total 
			  number of vectors stored will be length*block. (25)
		block	- (int) the block size. (1)
		which	- (string) the eigenvalues of interest. ("LM") This information is used to
			  sort the computed eigenvalues for those that the user is interested in.
			  The choices are:
				"LM" - largest magnitude
				"LR" - largest real part
				"LI" - largest imaginary part
				"SM" - smallest magnitude
				"SR" - smallest real part
				"SI" - smallest imaginary part
		step 	- (int) the number of steps to take in the expansion phase before checking
			  for convergence.  This allows the user to check for convergence sooner than
			  every restart. (25)
		restarts- (int) the number of restarts allows. (0) 
			  Note: restarting block Arnoldi is not recommended at this time.

	Methods:
		setDebugLevel	- this method allows the user to view debugging information.
				- If the integer is >0 then the solver will call currentStatus at
				  each restart.
				- If the integer is >2 then the user will see information on the
				  orthogonality of the block Arnoldi factorization.

		setSymmetric	- this method allows the user to inform the solver if the
				  problem is symmetric.  This avoids some unnecessary calculations.

		iterate		- this method allows the user to take a few steps in the iteration.

		solve		- this method iterates until the eigenvalues have converged, or the
				  maximum number of iterations has been reached.

		getEvecs	- this method returns a AnasaziMultiVec with the real part of the
				  eigenvector.  The imaginary part, if there is one, is returned
				  by getiEvecs.

		getEvals	- this method returns an array of TYPE with the real part of the 
				  computed eigenvalues.  The imaginary part, if there is one, is 
				  returned by getiEvals.

		getResiduals 	- this method returns an array of TYPE with the residuals of the 
				  computed eigenvalues.

		currentStatus  	- this method allows the user to view the internal status of the 
				  solver.

AnasaziMatrix.hpp
AnasaziOperator.hpp
	(multivec/matrix/operator virtual interfaces)	
	These files define the virtual interfaces that AnasaziBlockArnoldi rely on.  These
	interfaces must be filled out by the user to describe the underlying vector spaces.
	Two interfaces are provided at this time for Epetra and LOCA (see below).

AnasaziEigenproblem.hpp
	This is an interface to standard/generalized eigenproblems.  It holds the information
	about the eigenproblem, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, symmetry of the problem, and is responsible
	for applying the operator in the eigensolver. 

AnasaziPetraInterface.hpp
	This interface allows AnasaziBlockArnoldi to operate on Epetra multivecs and
	apply Epetra matrices.  An example is provided for this interface:  
	BlockArnoldiPetraEx.cpp	

AnasaziLOCAInterface.hpp
	This interface allows AnasaziBlockArnoldi to operate on a vector of NOX abstract
	vectors and use the NOX abstract group to apply the inverse Jacobian function.
	

Examples (found in anasazi/example):
-----------------------------
BlockArnoldiPetraEx.cpp
	This example computes the eigenvalues of a discretized 2D convection-diffusion
	equation.  It shows the construction of an Epetra matrix and initialization of 
	an AnasaziMatrix and AnasaziMultiVec.  This example also demonstrates how the 
	solver can be iterated or solved and how to extract information from the solver.
BlockArnoldiPetraExGen.cpp
	This example computes the eigenvalues of a 1D Laplacian discretized by linear
	finite elements.  This creates a generalized eigenvalue problem for Anasazi to
	solve.  It shows the construction of an Epetra matrix and initialize of an
	AnasaziMatrix and AnasaziMultiVec.  It also shows the BelosEpetraOperator can
	be used for the inner iteration within Anasazi.
BlockArnoldiPetraExHb.cpp
	This example computes the eigenvalues of a Harwell-Boeing matrix which is given
	as input.  This matrix is converted into an Epetra Matrix, then used with the
	Anasazi-Epetra interface.
