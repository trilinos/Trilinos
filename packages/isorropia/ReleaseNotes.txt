Release notes for Isorropia in dev Trilinos (June 2017):
------------------------------------------------------------

 - Removed experimental Tpetra interface.  The macro that would have
   enabled it was commented out, so it could never have built.  See
   discussion in #1406:
   https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/issues/1406

Release notes for Isorropia in Trilinos 10.10 (Feb. 2012):
------------------------------------------------------------
 - Changed license to BSD.

Release notes for Isorropia in Trilinos 10.8 (Sept. 2011):
------------------------------------------------------------
 - New class Isorropia::Epetra::Matcher solves the
   maximum cardinality matching problem for the bipartite graph.
   This is also known as a maximum transversal, and is
   typically used to permute a sparse matrix to zero-free diagonal form. 
   The current implementation uses OpenMP and shared memory model.
   It does not work on distributed matrices.
 - Isorropia is now supported in PyTrilinos.

Release notes for Isorropia in Trilinos 10.4 (July 2010):
------------------------------------------------------------
 - Improved documentation.
 - New RCP-free interface so users can choose whether to use
   raw pointers or Teuchos::RCP pointers. RCP is still recommended.
 - Experimental interface to Tpetra; disabled by default.

Release notes for Isorropia in Trilinos 10.2 (Mar. 2010):
------------------------------------------------------------
 - Isorropia::Epetra::Partitioner now supports three more
   partitioning methods from Zoltan: block, cyclic, and random.
 - Isorropia::Epetra::Partitioner now supports partitioning of maps. 


Release notes for Isorropia 3.2 (Trilinos 10.0), Sept. 2009:
------------------------------------------------------------

General:
 - New configuration and build system based on CMake. 
 - Isorropia now has a set of parameters for common options,
   such that many users do not need to use Zoltan parameters. 
   The parameters are case insensitive.
 - Zoltan parameters can still be set in a sublist named "Zoltan".

Partitioning:
 - Automatic symmetrization of graphs.
 - Geometric partitioning (RCB, RIB, HSFC) available via Epetra_MultiVector.
 - The internal partitioner ("simple_linear") has been removed.
 - New support for variable target part sizes. 
 - createBalancedCopy replaces create_balanced_copy and uses raw pointers
   instead of Teuchos::RCP. (The Partitioner class is the preferred API.)

Coloring:
 - Distance-2 coloring for Jacobians is now the default.
 - New methods Isorropia::Epetra::Colorer::generateRowMapColoring 
   and Isorropia::Epetra::Colorer::generateColMapColoring.

Prober:
 - New class to construct a sparse (CRS) matrix from an operator efficiently 
   via coloring.


Upgrading to version 3.2 (Trilinos 10.0):
-----------------------------------------
 - CMake has replaced automake. To enable Isorropia, use
   the option '-D Trilinos_ENABLE_Isorropia:BOOL=ON'.   
 - For partitioning, the partitioning method should now be specified
   by the new Isorropia parameter 'Partitioning Method', which
   corresponds to the Zoltan parameter "LB_METHOD".
 - create_balanced_copy has been deprecated. Please switch to using the
   Partitioner and Redistributor classes, or createBalancedCopy
   for quick and simple use.
