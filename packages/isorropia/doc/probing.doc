    \brief Here we describe the probing interface provided by Isorropia.

\section probingIntro Probing

Isorropia's distance-2 graph vertex capability enables matrix probing, the re-construction 
(or approximation) of a matrix from matrix-vector products with specially chosen vectors.  
These vectors are combinations of columns of the identity which are carefully chosen
such that the columns probed by such a vector are structurally orthogonal.  The most 
common use case of probing is when the matrix is not explicitly stored, but the matrix 
entries are necessary for some other procedure (e.g. preconditioning).  In certain 
applications, an exact reconstruction of the matrix is needed.  In others, an approximation 
based on <em>a priori</em> knowledge of the "significant" matrix entries suffices.  Isorropia's probing
functionality works in both cases.  See \ref probing for an example of how probing is used.

Currently, Isorropia's probing functionality is limited to structurally symmetric matrices but we expect 
to support nonsymmetric matrices (e.g. Jacobians) in the future.
