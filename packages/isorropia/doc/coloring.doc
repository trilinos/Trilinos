/** \defgroup coloring_grp Isorropia Coloring Methods  

    \brief Here we describe the coloring interface provided by Isorropia.

\section coloringIntro Coloring



Isorropia supports vertex coloring of a graph via Zoltan. Both distance-1 and distance-2 coloring 
is supported. See the Zoltan User's guide (available at the <a href=http://www.cs.sandia.gov/zoltan>
Zoltan web site</a>) for details. Currently, coloring is limited to structurally symmetric matrices 
but we expect to support nonsymmetric matrices (e.g., Jacobians) in the future.
