section 0: where you should look for IFPACK documentation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can download the IFPACK User's Guide at the web address

   http://trilinos.sandia.gov/packages/ml/

This address also contains up-to-date doxygen documentation. 
You can create a local Doxygen documentation by simply typing 

   $ doxygen

in the ml/doc subdirectory. Doxygen files mainly refer to the C++ interface
of IFPACK, and discuss in some details several examples.

An (incomplete) history of IFPACK changes is contained in file ChangeLog.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
section 1: configuring and compiling IFPACK
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We suggest to configure and compile IFPACK through the Trilinos configure
script. For instance, you might need something like
 
   $ cd Trilinos
   $ mkdir LINUX_SERIAL
   $ cd LINUX_SERIAL
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   
On most machines, an MPI configuration can be configured by simply
typing

   $ cd Trilinos
   $ mkdir LINUX_MPI
   $ cd LINUX_MPI
   $ ../configure --with-mpi-compilers
   $ make


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
section 2: testing IFPACK
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once IFPACK is compiled, a simple sanity check can be performed as follows:

   $ cd <your-ml-build-directory>
   $ cd example
   $ ./test.exe

The BASH script test will execute most of the examples, and verify that the exit
code of all of them.

section 4: organization of the examples
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following files, located in Trilinos/packages/ifpack/examples, can be
used to understand the basic usage of IFPACK:

*) Ifpack_ex_Factory: explains how to define IFPACK preconditioners using
                      the Factory class. This is probably the easiest way
                      to use IFPACK. Beginners should start from this file.

*) Ifpack_ex_ICT.exe: explains how to define incomplete Cholesky
                      preconditioners.

*) Ifpack_ex_MatrixMarket.exe: explains how to read a matrix in matrix-market
                      format, distribute it among the available processes,
                      and use IFPACK preconditioners to solve the
                      corresponding linear system.

*) Ifpack_ex_Amesos.exe: explains how to use complete (exact) LU
                      factorizations on each subdomain, using the Amesos package.

*) Ifpack_ex_BlockRelaxation.exe: explains how to define block relaxation
                      methods.

*) Ifpack_ex_Filtering.exe: explains how to modify the linear system matrix,
                      in order to improve the quality of the incomplete
                      factors (for IC, ICT, ILU and ILUT).

*) Ifpack_ex_Test.exe: explains how to test several IFPACK parameters,
                      on a matrix read from file using EpetraExt.

*) Ifpack_ex_Reordering.exe: details how reordering works within IFPACK. Only
                      for advanced users.

*) Ifpack_ex_SingletonFilter.exe: details how singleton filtering works with
                      IFPACK. Only for advanced users.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
section 5: organization and scope of the tests
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Subdirectory test contains several test harness source files.
These files are meant for developers and not for users. A simple script,
located in the examples subdirectory, can be adopted by users to perform
a basic and quick sanity check of IFPACK.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
section 6: how to submit bugs
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bugs and enhancements can be submitted through bugzilla at the web page

   http://software.sandia.gov/bugzilla

(select IFPACK in the list of packages).
You will need to create a bugzilla account. Otherwise, simply e-mail
to one of the developers.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
section 7: mailing lists
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Users can subscribe to the following mailing lists:
*) ifpack-announce@software.sandia.gov
*) ifpack-users@software.sandia.gov

Please refer to the IFPACK web page for more details.

section 8: how to cite IFPACK
