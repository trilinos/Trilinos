/** \brief Strategy for driving LSCPreconditionerFactory.
 *
 * Strategy for driving the LSCPreconditionerFactory. This
 * class provides all the pieces required by the LSC preconditioner.
 * The intent is that the user can overide them and build
 * there own implementation. Though a fairly substantial implementation
 * is provided in <code>InvLSCStrategy</code>.
 *
 * The basics of this method can be found in
 *
 * [1] Elman, Howle, Shadid, Silvester, and Tuminaro, "Least Squares Preconditioners
 *     for Stabilized Discretizations of the Navier-Stokes Euqations," SISC-2007.
 *
 * [2] Elman, and Tuminaro, "Boundary Conditions in Approximate Commutator
 *     Preconditioners for the Navier-Stokes Equations," In press (8/2009)?
 *
 * The Least Squares Commuator preconditioner provides a (nearly) Algebraic approximation
 * of the Schur complement of the (Navier-)Stokes system
 *
 * \f$ A = \left[\begin{array}{cc}
 *        F & B^T \\
 *        B & C
 *     \end{array}\right] \f$
 *
 * The approximation to the Schur complement is
 *
 * \f$ C - B F^{-1} B^T \approx (B \hat{Q}_u^{-1} B^T - \gamma C)^{-1}
 *       (B \hat{Q}_u^{-1} F H B^T+C_I) (B H B^T - \gamma C)^{-1}
 *     + C_O \f$.
 *
 * Where \f$\hat{Q}_u\f$ is typically a diagonal approximation of the mass matrix,
 * and \f$H\f$ is an appropriate diagonal scaling matrix (see [2] for details).
 * The scalars \f$\alpha\f$ and \f$\gamma\f$ are chosen to stabilize an unstable
 * discretization (for the case of \f$C\neq 0\f$). If the system is stable then
 * they can be set to \f$0\f$ (see [1] for more details).
 *
 * In order to approximate \f$A\f$ two decompositions can be chosen, a full LU
 * decomposition and a purely upper triangular version. A full LU decomposition
 * requires that the velocity convection-diffusion operator (\f$F\f$) is inverted
 * twice, while an upper triangular approximation requires only a single inverse.
 *
 * The methods of this strategy provide the different pieces. For instance
 * <code>getInvF</code> provides \f$F^{-1}\f$. Similarly there are calls to get
 * the inverses of \f$B \hat{Q}_u^{-1} B^T - \gamma C\f$,
 * \f$B \hat{Q}_u^{-1} B^T - \gamma C\f$, and \f$\hat{Q}_u^{-1}\f$ as well as
 * the \f$H\f$ operator. All these methods are required by the
 * <code>LSCPreconditionerFactory</code>. Additionally there is a
 * <code>buildState</code> method that is called everytime a preconditiner is
 * (re)constructed. This is to allow for any preprocessing neccessary to be
 * handled.
 *
 * The final set of methods help construct a LSCStrategy object, they are
 * primarily used by the parameter list construction inteface. They are
 * more advanced and can be ignored by initial implementations of this
 * class.
