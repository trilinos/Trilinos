% This is an example of how to create the distribution page. Some
% distributions are required by Sandia; e.g. the housekeeping copies.
% Depending on the type of report; e.g. CRADA, Patent Caution, etc.
% additional distribution lines may have to be added. See the
% "Guide for Preparing SAND Reports"
%
% SANDdistribution takes CA or NM as an optional argument. If given,
% the approrpiate housekeeping copies are inserted autmatically.
% Inside the SANDdistribution environment, several commands can be used
% insert the distributions for CRADA, LDRD, etc. See example below.
%
% You can leave the CA or NM option off and not use any of the SANDdist*
% commands. This will allow you to create a distribution list manually.
%
\begin{SANDdistribution}[NM]
    % Housekeeping copies necessary for every unclassified report:
    % \SANDdistCRADA	% If this report is about CRADA work
    % \SANDdistPatent	% If this report has a Patent Caution or Patent Interest
    % \SANDdistLDRD	% If this report is about LDRD work

    % Some external Addresses

    \SANDdistExternal{1}{Roscoe A. Bartlett\\ Oak Ridge National Laboratory \\ P.O. Box 2008 \\ Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37831 \\ United States }
    % \SANDdistExternal{3}{Some Address\\ and street\\City, State}
    % \SANDdistExternal{12}{Another Address\\ On a street\\City, State\\U.S.A.}
    %\bigskip

    % The following MUST BE between the external and internal distributions!
