===================================
Setting up a Trilinos CDash server:
===================================


[ These notes were recorded during the transition to the CDash installation
  on testing.sandia.gov leading up to July 2011. ]

CDash runs as a php web app on a web server that is (or can connect to) a
database server. Typically, this means running on a web server with a LAMP
software stack installed. (Linux+Apache+MySQL+php)

The typical setup instructions are:

- Use a good quality database-server-grade machine as hardware:
  ...ideally, this will obviously have:
  -- fast disk, (100G or even more free for the MySQL database)
  -- lots of RAM (16G or more)
  -- fast multi-CPU

- Make sure your server has all the pre-requisites installed

  http://public.kitware.com/Wiki/CDash:Installation
  http://public.kitware.com/Wiki/CDash:Installation#System_Requirements

- MySQL 5.x

- php 5.3 or higher, with:
  - xslt enabled
  - curl enabled

Possible Problem:
When first loading the CDash CDASH_ROOT/install.php page, I got this notice:
  Your PHP install does not support xslt, please install the PHP_XSLT package.
  WAMP Hint: uncomment extension=php_xsl.dll in php.ini.

- Add a MySQL user 'cdash' specifically for the CDash code to access the CDash
MySQL database (see notes below regarding "Creating a MySQL 'cdash' user" -
this user needs permission to create a database, or you need to create the
database yourself first, and then give this user permissions in the database
as outlined below)

- Get the source tree for CDash onto the server (trunk/HEAD from the
repository or a release)

- Add a minimal config file at "CDASH_ROOT/cdash/config.local.php"
  - Initially, set the varibles $CDASH_PRODUCTION_MODE=false,
    $CDASH_TESTING_MODE=true

- Make this CDash instance available via http (put it in /var/www/html or
wherever your apache htdocs go...)

- Make sure the following directories have write access by the apache user.
The CDash php code writes files into these directories.

  CDASH_ROOT/backup
  CDASH_ROOT/rss
  CDASH_ROOT/upload

- Visit "http://myserver.some.org/CDash/install.php" which runs the CDash install.php
  page on the first visit

- Correct any issues noted on the CDash install page

- in cdash/config.local.php, change back to $CDASH_PRODUCTION_MODE=true,
    $CDASH_TESTING_MODE=fasle.

- Make the appropriate set of people sign up for accounts on this new CDash
server and make them server admins

- Create your project via the CDash admin pages

- Try a test submission to the new CDash server

- Switch your project's CTestConfig.cmake file to point to the new CDash
server

- You can monitor the status of the asynchronous submission processing by
going to the "http://myserver.some.org/CDash/monitor.php" page. A link to
that page may be found on the CDash admin page. You must be logged in as a
CDash admin in order to view either of those pages.


==========================
Trilinos specific caveats:
==========================

- Make sure emails are being sent properly
  If you're not receiving a test email, check your spam folder, too...


==============
php.ini stuff:
==============

- Make sure the timezone setting in php.ini is correct

You can find what php.ini is loaded by visiting
http://myserver.some.org/CDash/svninfo.php and logging in as the CDash admin

This prevents php warnings like these from showing up in the apache http
error logs:

  [Thu Jul 28 12:08:37 2011] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] PHP Warning:
  date(): It is not safe to rely on the system's timezone settings. You
  are *required* to use the date.timezone setting or
  the date_default_timezone_set() function. In case you used any of those
  methods and you are still getting this warning, you most likely
  misspelled the timezone identifier. We selected 'America/Denver' for
  'MDT/-6.0/DST' instead in /var/www/html/cdash/cdash/createRSS.php on
  line 99


============
MySQL stuff:
============

- Tuning the MySQL server:

  http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Tuning-primer.sh

  http://mysqltuner.com

- max_allowed_packet:

You should increase the size of the MySQL max_allowed_packet setting. Setting
it to 256MB is sufficient to handle test output up to more than 100MB.

Add this line to "/etc/my.cnf"

  max_allowed_packet = 256MB

Running this command should do that for you:

  mysql --max_allowed_packet=256MB

Or: "change /etc/my.cnf and restart mysqld"

The default is 16, the max is 1 GB.  The system will be smart about what
packet size is actually used, so a larger max packet size than necessary
isn't harmful.

- Case Sensitivity

On some servers, MySQL queries are case sensitive. If you are searching for
something that should be there in a CDash "filtered results" page and it is
not there, try searching with the exact case. You may have to reset a MySQL
server setting to get case insensitive searches.

- MySQL error code 28 means your disk is full

- phpmyadmin

Install a phpmyadmin that connects to the CDash MySQL server. After running
for a day or two with the expected submission and user interactivity level,
look at the phpmyadmin status page. Scrolling down through there, you should
see some fields that are highlighted in bold or red. Read through those
reports carefully for suggestions on how you can tune your MySQL server to
optimize it for the actual traffic that you're getting.

- Slow Queries

You can turn on MySQL slow query logging if you are having speed/performance
issues, but turning it on will slow things down by a bit. So keeping if off
for best possible performance is recommended. Turn it on only to diagnose
issues and identify slow queries. Don't just leave it on all the time.

- Optimizing

For best performance, the MySQL database should be checked and/or optimized
periodically (every week or two?)

For example, on cdash.org, when it was based on MyISAM tables, we ran this
command every 2 weeks:
  myisamchk --force --repair \
    --key_buffer_size=64M --sort_buffer_size=64M \
    --read_buffer_size=1M --write_buffer_size=1M \
    /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI


==============================
apache .htaccess restrictions
==============================

With the following .htaccess, submissions work despite the fact that general
read access by folks is otherwise restricted (to internal network addresses,
or requiring passwords, or any other htaccess restriction...):


[xxx@testing cdash]$ pwd
/var/www/html/cdash


[xxx@testing cdash]$ cat .htaccess
<Files dailyupdatescurl.php>
    Options +ExecCGI +Indexes +Includes
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
</Files>

<Files processsubmissions.php>
    Options +ExecCGI +Indexes +Includes
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
</Files>

<Files submit.php>
    Options +ExecCGI +Indexes +Includes
    Order Allow,Deny
    Allow from all
</Files>


The three files mentioned require unauthenticated access for a
non-https-enabled ctest to be able to submit to them... If you have apache
access restrictions in place for the CDash server, you'll need to allow these
if you want the default installations of ctest to be able to submit to the
server from anywhere.


======================================
Using External (apache) Authentication
======================================

"The idea is that you set your apache with Basic Auth. Usually by
placing a .htaccess at the CDash level:

 AuthType Basic
 AuthName "By Invitation Only"
 AuthUserFile /usr/local/apache/passwd/passwords
 Require valid-user

This will let apache deal with the authentication and redirect to
CDash with credentials. And then setting the CDash variable

 $CDASH_EXTERNAL_AUTH = '1';

will tell CDash to use the credential provided by apache instead of
its own."


==============================
Creating a MySQL 'cdash' user:
==============================

I need the CREATE USER privilege to do this myself.

mysql> create user cdash IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
ERROR 1227 (42000): Access denied; you need the CREATE USER privilege
for this operation


Here are my privileges as I can see them on a mysql that works:

mysql> show grants;
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for xxxx@localhost                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT FILE ON *.* TO 'xxxx'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD 'XXXXX' |
| GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `cdashtrilinos`.* TO'xxxx'@'localhost'                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)


Additional mysql help info:

mysql> help create user;
Name: 'CREATE USER'
Description:
Syntax:
CREATE USER user [IDENTIFIED BY [PASSWORD] 'password']
   [, user [IDENTIFIED BY [PASSWORD] 'password']] ...

The CREATE USER statement was added in MySQL 5.0.2. This statement
creates new MySQL accounts. To use it, you must have the global CREATE
USER privilege or the INSERT privilege for the mysql database. For each
account, CREATE USER creates a new record in the mysql.user table that
has no privileges. An error occurs if the account already exists. Each
account is named using the same format as for the GRANT statement; for
example, 'jeffrey'@'localhost'. The user and host parts of the account
name correspond to the User and Host column values of the user table
row for the account.

The account can be given a password with the optional IDENTIFIED BY
clause. The user value and the password are given the same way as for
the GRANT statement. In particular, to specify the password in plain
text, omit the PASSWORD keyword. To specify the password as the hashed
value as returned by the PASSWORD() function, include the PASSWORD
keyword. See [grant].


=======================
MySQL privileges:
=======================

You can see your own privileges from within mysql by executing:

mysql> show grants;
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for xxxx@localhost                                                          |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'xxxx'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' | 
| GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `cdashtrilinos`.* TO 'xxxx'@'localhost'                    | 
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

If I give my testuser the "FILE" global privilege, then I can do the
mysqlimport operation that I've been attempting on server.name.here.
I've been testing it locally on my own machine.


As 'xxxx':
mysql> show grants;
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for xxxx@localhost
                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT FILE ON *.* TO 'xxxx'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD
'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' |
| GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `cdashtrilinos`.* TO
'xxxx'@'localhost'                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


As 'cdash':
mysql> show grants;
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for cdash@localhost
              |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'cdash'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY PASSWORD
'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx' |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


I need "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES" for the "cdashtrilinos" database on the "cdash"
mysql user account. I tried to grant it myself (as "xxxx"), but could not.


=======================
"Crashed" MySQL Tables:
=======================

In mysql, the command:

  show table status;

will show tables in the current database, and their statuses... tables
that need repair will report a Comment something like "Table
'./database-name/table-name' is marked as crashed and should be
repaired" and most of the rest of the table status fields will report
as "NULL" - You can then attempt to repair such tables with the mysql
command:

  repair table table-name;

The cdash database had 7 of its 84 tables listed with the "crashed"
status. Repairing them took about 45 minutes. (One table by itself
took more than 18 minutes to repair.)

Google "mysql repair table" for more info.
