======================================
Submitting a TribitsDriver dashboard:
======================================


A) Prerequisites:
=================

First, manually ensure that the following prerequisites are satisfied:

(*) python version 2.4 or later

(*) eg or git version 1.6.x or later


B) Create a base directory:
===========================

Create a directory as a base and clone the sources

  $ cd <somebasedir>
  $ mkdir Dashboards
  $ cd Dashboards
  $ git clone something.blah.gov/<PROJECT>
  # Also, clone any other sources as well needed.


C) Create machine specific content:
===================================

Add a subdirectory (optionally) named after your machine in
<PROJECT>/cmake/ctest/drivers. If you name the directory exactly as your
machine is named by `uname -n` then you simply need to add some files to that
directory. You can drop ".domain.gov" stuff from the end of the machine name,
as long as the name does not conflict with any other directory names already
in the drivers directory.

Add some ctest -S scripts to run as tests. You can base the *.cmake
files in this directory on those used on an existing machine that is
substantially similar to yours. If there isn't one, just copy the
files from the s903186 directory and work from there.

Add a CMakeLists.txt file to the new directory for your machine. It
should contain content something like this (from the flagship example,
s903186):

  # Initially:
  #
  TRIBITS_DRIVER_SETUP()

  # Make one of these calls for each script
  #
  TRIBITS_DRIVER_ADD_DASHBOARD(
    MPI_OPT
    ctest_mac_nightly_mpi_opt_s903186.cmake
  )

  TRIBITS_DRIVER_ADD_DASHBOARD(
    SERIAL_DEBUG
    ctest_mac_nightly_serial_debug_s903186.cmake
  )

  # Finally:
  #
  TRIBITS_ADD_REQUIRED_CMAKE_INSTALLS()

The first argument to TRIBITS_DRIVER_ADD_DASHBOARD calls is the test
name as it will appear on the <Project>Driver dashboard. The second
argument is the name of the script in the same directory that will be
run as a ctest -S script as a test on the driver dashboard.

If you have a dashboard that must run all by itself, without any other
dashboards being run in parallel, then you should pass the RUN_SERIAL
argument.

For more details on other optional arguments, see the comments at the
function definition for TRIBITS_DRIVER_ADD_DASHBOARD in
TribitsDriverSupport.cmake.

WARNING: The name of the build (the first argument, e.g. MPI_OPT)
should be the same as the name of the build set in the *.cmake driver
file (the second argument,
e.g. ctest_mac_nightly_mpi_opt_s903186.cmake).  There are no checks in
place to make sure that this is true.  You have been warned!

Next, add a cron_driver.sh for your machine. (Or cron_driver.bat on
Windows.)

You can set the environment variable TDD_PARALLEL_LEVEL to control how
many dashboards are run in parallel (as tests) by the <Project>Driver
dashboard.

You may also need to set the environment variable TDD_HTTP_PROXY for
your http proxy which is needed if the script download-cmake.py can't
figure it out the proxy automatically.  For Sandia machines, this is
http://wwwproxy.sandia.gov:80/.

Typical cron_driver.sh contents:

  export TDD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=2
  export TDD_HTTP_PROXY="http://wwwproxy.sandia.gov:80/"
  ../cron_driver.py

Typical cron_driver.bat contents:

  set TDD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=2
  set TDD_HTTP_PROXY="http://wwwproxy.sandia.gov:80/"
  python "%~dp0..\cron_driver.py"


D) Run the scripts manually to test them:
=========================================

Before setting up the final cron job, you should test the individual
CTest driver scripts and the outer <Project>Driver script.


D.1) Test out individual CTest dashboard builds first:
------------------------------------------------------

Before running your outer cron driver script, you would be wise to first test
out your individual CTest driver scripts (e.g. MPI_OPT, SERIAL_DEBUG, etc.).
You can test individual basic ctest driver scripts to clone the project and
create the BUILD directroy by creating your own temp base directory and then
overridding CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT for example as:

  $ mkdir MOCK_MPI_OPT
  $ cd MOCK_MPI_OPT
  $ env  CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT=$PWD  <Project>_PACKAGES=Teuchos \
     CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental \
     <Project>_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE=Nightly CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=OFF \
     CTEST_DO_UPDATES=TRUE  CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=TRUE \
     CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES=TRUE \
     ctest -S <somedir>/cmake/ctest/drivers/s903186/ctest_mac_nightly_mpi_opt_s903186.cmake

Running the above will clone <Project> into MOCK_MPI_OPT/<Project> and will
create the build directory in MOCK_MPI_OPT/BUILD.  After the initial clone is
performed above, you can speed up subsequent testing by additionally setting
CTEST_DO_UPDATES=FALSE and CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=FALSE on
the environment.  You can keep running this 'env ... ctest -S ...' command
until you get everything working.  All of the info needed to debug problems
should be present in the output from 'ctest -VV -S' (which you should pipe to
a file and then examine).

If you want to test the exact state of the local changes in <somedir>,
you can avoid pulling commits by creating a symbolic link and running as:

  $ mkdir MOCK_MPI_OPT
  $ cd MOCK_MPI_OPT
  $ ln -s  <somedir> <Project>
  $ env  CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT=$PWD  <Project>_PACKAGES=Teuchos \
     CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental \
     <Project>_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE=Nightly CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=OFF \
     <Project>_IGNORE_MISSING_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES=ON CTEST_DO_UPDATES=OFF \
     CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=TRUE \
     CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES=TRUE \
     ctest -S <somedir>/cmake/ctest/drivers/s903186/ctest_mac_nightly_mpi_opt_s903186.cmake

Note that above it is critical that you set CTEST_DO_UPDATES=OFF so that it
will not try to reset your repos and wipe out your changes or have merge
conflicts for extra repos.  The option
<Project>_IGNORE_MISSING_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES=ON allows you to be missing some
extra repos so that you can test with just the extra repos that you have
cloned.  Note that this will not test the exact state of the project that
would be in automated testing.  If you want to assert that the exact list of
repos is cloned already, then set
<Project>_IGNORE_MISSING_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES=OFF or leave off that argument.

After the local CTest processes are working, just to make sure the
submit works, you can run a final trial build with:

  $ env  CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT=$PWD  <Project>_PACKAGES=Teuchos \
     CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental CTEST_DO_UPDATES=FALSE \
     <Project>_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE=Nightly \
     CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=ON CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=FALSE \
     CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES=TRUE \
     ctest -S <somedir>/cmake/ctest/drivers/s903186/ctest_mac_nightly_mpi_opt_s903186.cmake

If this submits to the 'Experimental' CDash dashbaord, you should be
in good shape for the nightly test.  If you can't find you
experimental build on the CDash dashboard, then something is wrong.

NOTES:

a) Different Trilinos git repos: When CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental or
CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Continuous then Trilinos is initially cloned from form the
main development repo.  However, when CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Nightly then Trilinos
will be initially cloned from a specially maintained 'nightly' repo.  (The
purpose of the 'nightly' repo is to ensure that all Nightly builds use exactly
the same version of the sources and report consistent results in case someone
pushes in between the first Nightly pull and later Nightly pulls.)  Therefore,
if you use CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental when first testing in the actually
final directory location for the Nightly dashboard (such as will occur when
testing the cron_driver.sh script described below) then subsequent pulls will
occur from the main development repo *NOT* the special 'nightly' repo.  To get
back to the 'nightly' repo, you must delete the locally cloned Trilinos repo
so that when the script runs with CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Nightly, it will clone from
the 'nightly' repo and do subsequent updates form the 'nightly' repo.  If you
want to totally override which repo gets pulled form, you can set that with
the variable <Project>_REPOSITORY_LOCATION.


D.2) Testing the outer cron driver script:
------------------------------------------

To test this script manually, you must move into the driver scripts directory
and run from there:

  $ cd <DRIVERS_BASE_DIR>
  $ env \
      <PROJECT_NAME>_PACKAGES=Teuchos \
      TDD_IN_TESTING_MODE=ON \
      TDD_CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental \
      CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental \
      CTEST_DO_UPDATES=TRUE \
      TDD_DO_SUBMIT=FALSE \
      CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=FALSE  \
      CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=TRUE \
      CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES=TRUE \
      ./cron_driver_somemachine.sh

Once you are done with the initial run, you can test it out
interactively in a rapid, iterative process by setting up the
following additionial environment variables:

  $ cd <DRIVERS_BASE_DIR>
  $ env \
      <Project>_PACKAGES=Teuchos \
      CTEST_DO_UPDATES=FALSE \
      CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=FALSE \
      TDD_DO_SUBMIT=FALSE \
      TDD_IN_TESTING_MODE=ON \
      CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=FALSE \
      TDD_CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental \
      CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental \
      TDD_FORCE_CMAKE_INSTALL=0 \
      TDD_FORCE_INNER_CMAKE_INSTALL=0 \
      CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES=TRUE \
      CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=FALSE \
      ./cron_driver_somemachine.sh

(of course you must use set commands on Windows).

NOTES:

(*) Set <Project>_PACKAGES=Teuchos to whatever your project name is and
    some upstream package.  For Trilinos, this would be something like
    Trilinos_PACKAGES=Teuchos.  For another project you would use its
    project name and one of its upstream packages.
(*) Set TDD_FORCE_CMAKE_INSTALL=0 to skip global CMake reinstall.
(*) Set TDD_FORCE_INNER_CMAKE_INSTALL=0 to skip tests that install
    the inner CMake/CTest used by individual builds.
(*) Set CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES=FALSE if you only
    want to process the exact packages set with <Project>_PACKAGES
(*) Set CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=TRUE after a first round of builds
    to speed up subsequent builds.

Work out any kinks you may have in your environment and your scripts
by running this over and over again.

Once you are confident that your driver script is working correctly,
you should try to run this as a cron job using the command (see the
entire command below in the "cron driver" section):

  $ env  <Project>_PACKAGES=Teuchos  CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=ON  TDD_DO_SUBMIT=ON \
      CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=FALSE \
      CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental \
      TDD_FORCE_CMAKE_INSTALL=1 # If you want to force outer CMake upgrade \
      <yourdirverssroucedir>/cron_driver_somemachine.sh

Note the submits variables are turned on which means that the inner and outer
submits will be performed to the <Project> and <Project>Driver dashboards,
respectively.  If this submits to the CDash dashboards, you should be ready to
set up your final cron job driver (see below).

WARNING: Blow away all of the base dashboard directories that get created
during this process before running the final cron job!  You must do this so
that the correct git nightly repository will get cloned in the inner CTest
dashboards.  You would do this with:

  $ cd ~/T
  $ rm -rf MPI_DEBUG SERIAL_RELEASE ...


E) Debugging problems:
======================

Debugging the inner CTest dashbaords should be more straightforward as
described in D.1 above.

When first getting the outer <Project>Driver script to run, there can be
problems that you will have to debug.  The output to the console from the
cron_driver.py script is very sparse but will be of some help.  Almost all of
the output from the various stages are contained under the base build/test
directory.  The base build directory for the outer CTest <Project>Driver
script is in:

  ~/T/TDD_BUILD

You can find the output from the various configure, build, tests in
the date-specific subdirectory under:

  ~/T/TDD_BUILD/Testing/Temporary/

Note that you will also find the output from the
TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake script as the test output in:

  T/TDD_BUILD/Testing/Temporary/LastTest_XXX.log

Also, of course all of the output for each build case (BUILD_CASE) is
in:

  T/BUILD_CASE/Testing/Temporary/

where BUILD_CASE = MPI_OPT, SERIAL_DEBUG etc.

Good luck in debugging!


F) Set up a crontab entry (or a scheduled task on Windows):
===========================================================

After you have successfully manually testing the inner and outer
driver scripts, you will be ready to create the final crontab entry.
You can set this with 'crontab -e' or install the cron driver script
in whole.

The contents of your cron driver should look like:

  MAILTO=youremail@yourorg.org
  10 00 * * * cd  ~/T/<Project>/cmake/ctest/drivers/MACHINE_NAME && ./cron_driver.sh &> ~/T/cron_driver.log

Typical values are MM=10 and HH=00 which starts things off at 10 minutes after
midnight.  The testing day time may move earlier (e.g. 8 PM MST) but it will
not start after Midnight so that value is safe.  You can start your cron
driver at any time after the beginning of a new testing day (as defined by
CTest/CDash configuration).


G) Commit changes to the driver scripts:
========================================

You must commit and push changes in <Project>/cmake/ctest/drivers into the
main Trilinos git repository.  To do this, do:

  $ cd ~/T/<Project>
  $ eg remote add trilinos software:/space/git/Trilinos
  $ eg pull trilinos
  $ eg commit
  $ eg rebase --against trilinos/origin
  $ eg push

Hopefully, that should push your changes back and you should be ready
to let the cron job run on its own every day.  If that does not work,
cherry-pick your commits into a different local Trilinos repo cloned
directly from software:/space/git/Trilinos and do the push from there
(this is what I have had to do in the past).  Do this as:

  $ cd $SOME_OTHER_BASE/Trilinos
  $ eg remote add nighly_cdash ~/T/Trilinos
  $ eg pull nighly_cdash master
  $ eg pull
  $ eg rebase --against origin/master
  $ eg push

Of course, if you change anything other than what is in your
driver/MACHINE_NAME directory, you should use the checkin-test.py
script to test and push your commits.
