#
# @MACRO: TRIBITS_REPOSITORY_DEFINE_PACKAGES()
#
# Define the set of packages for a given `TriBITS Repository`_.  This macro is
# typically called from inside of a `<repoDir>/PackagesList.cmake`_ file for a
# given TriBITS repo.
#
# Usage::
#
#    TRIBITS_REPOSITORY_DEFINE_PACKAGES(
#       <pkg0>  <pkg0_dir>  <pkg0_classif>
#       <pkg1>  <pkg1_dir>  <pkg1_classif>
#       ...
#       )
#
# This macro sets up a 2D array of ``NumPackages`` by ``NumColumns`` listing
# out the packages for a TriBITS repository.  Each row (with 3 column entries)
# specifies a package which contains the columns (ordered 0-2):
#
# 0. **PACKAGE** (``<pkgi>``): The name of the TriBITS package.  This name
#    must be unique across all other TriBITS packages in this or any other
#    TriBITS repo that might be combined into a single TriBITS project
#    meta-build (see `Globally unique TriBITS package names`_).  The name
#    should be a valid identifier (e.g. matches the regex
#    ``[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*``).  The package names tend to use mixed case
#    (e.g. ```SomePackge`` not ``SOMEPACKGE``).
#
# 1. **DIR** (``<pkgi_dir>``): The relative directory for the package
#    ``<packageDir>``.  This directory is relative to the TriBITS repository
#    base directory ``<repoDir>``.  Under this directory will be a
#    package-specific ``cmake/`` directory with the file
#    `<packageDir>/cmake/Dependencies.cmake`_ and a base-level
#    `<packageDir>/CMakeLists.txt`_ file.  The entire contents of the package
#    including all of the source code and all of the tests should be contained
#    under this directory.  The TriBITS testing infrastructure relies on the
#    mapping of changed files to these base directories when deciding what
#    packages are modified and need to be retested (along with downstream
#    packages).  For details, see `checkin-test.py`_.
#
# 2. **CLASSIFICATION** (``<pkgi_classif>``): Gives the `SE Package Test
#    Group`_ `PT`_, `ST`_, or `EX`_ and the maturity level ``EP``, ``RS``,
#    ``PG``, ``PM``, ``GRS``, ``GPG``, ``GPM``, ``UM``.  These are separated
#    by a coma with no space in between such as ``"RS,PT"`` for a "Research
#    Stable", "Primary Tested" package.  No spaces are allowed so that CMake
#    treats this a one field in the array.  The maturity level can be left off
#    in which case it is assumed to be ``UM`` for "Unspecified Maturity".
#    This classification for individual packages can be changed to ``EX`` for
#    specific platforms by calling `TRIBITS_DISABLE_PACKAGE_ON_PLATFORMS()`_.
#
# **IMPORTANT:** The packages must be listed in increasing order of package
# dependencies.  That is `No circular dependencies of any kind are allowed`_
# (see the *ADP (Acyclic Dependencies Principle)* in `Software Engineering
# Packaging Principles`_).  Package ``i`` can only list dependencies (in
# `<packageDir>/cmake/Dependencies.cmake`_) for packages listed before this
# package in this list (or in upstream TriBITS repositories).  This avoids an
# expensive package sorting algorithm and makes it easy to flag packages with
# circular dependencies or misspelling of package names.
#
# NOTE: For some rare use cases, the package directory ``<pkgi_dir>`` is
# allowed to be specified as an absolute directory but this absolute directory
# must be a subdirectory of the project source base directory given by
# `PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR`_.  If not, ``MESSAGE(FATAL_ERROR ...)`` is called and
# processing stops immediately.
#
# NOTE: This macro just sets the variable::
#
#   ${REPOSITORY_NAME}_PACKAGES_AND_DIRS_AND_CLASSIFICATIONS
#
# in the current scope.  The advantages of using this macro instead of
# directly setting this variable are that the macro:
#
# * Asserts that the variable ``REPOSITORY_NAME`` is defined and set
#
# * Avoids having to hard-code the assumed repository name
#   ``${REPOSITORY_NAME}``.  This provides more flexibility for how other
#   TriBITS projects choose to name a given TriBITS repo (i.e. the name of
#   repo subdirs).
#
# * Avoid misspelling the name of the variable
#   ``${REPOSITORY_NAME}_PACKAGES_AND_DIRS_AND_CLASSIFICATIONS``.  If one
#   misspells the name of the macro, it is an immediate error in CMake.

#
# @FUNCTION: TRIBITS_ALLOW_MISSING_EXTERNAL_PACKAGES()
#
# Allow listed packages to be missing and automatically excluded from the
# package dependency data-structures.
#
# Usage::
#
#   TRIBITS_ALLOW_MISSING_EXTERNAL_PACKAGES(<pkg0> <plg1> ...)
#
# If the missing upstream SE package ``<pkgi>`` is optional, then the effect
# will be to simply ignore the missing package (i.e. it will never be added to
# package's list and not added to dependency data-structures) and remove it
# from the dependency lists for downstream SE packages that have an optional
# dependency on the missing upstream SE package ``<pkgi>``.  However, all
# downstream SE packages that have a required dependency on the missing
# upstream SE package ``<pkgi>`` will be hard disabled,
# i.e. ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_{CURRENT_PACKAGE}=OFF`` and a note on the
# disable will be printed.
# 
# **WARNING**: This macro just sets the cache variable
# ``<pkgi>_ALLOW_MISSING_EXTERNAL_PACKAGE=TRUE`` for each SE package
# ``<pkgi>``.  Therefore, using this function effectively turns off error
# checking for misspelled package names so it is important to only use it when
# it absolutely is needed (use cases mentioned below).  Also note that missing
# packages are silently ignored by default.  Therefore, when doing development
# involving these packages, it is usually a good idea to set::
#
#   -D<pkgi>_ALLOW_MISSING_EXTERNAL_PACKAGE=FALSE
#
# so that it will catch errors in the misspelling of package names or source
# directories.  However, notes on what missing packages are being ignored can
# printed by configuring with::
#
#   -D <Project>_WARN_ABOUT_MISSING_EXTERNAL_PACKAGES=TRUE
#
# This macro is typically called in one of two different contexts:
#
# * Called from `<packageDir>/cmake/Dependencies.cmake`_ when the upstream
#   package ``<pkgi>`` is defined in an optional upstream `TriBITS
#   Repository`_.  This allows the downstream repos and packages to still be
#   enabled (assuming they don't have required dependencies on the missing
#   packages) when one or more upstream repos are missing.
#
# * Called from `<repoDir>/PackagesList.cmake`_ when the package ``<pkgi>``
#   might be defined in an optional non-TriBITS repo (see `How to insert a
#   package into an upstream repo`_).
#
# For some meta-projects that composes packages from may different TriBITS
# repositories, one might need to also call this function from the file
# `<projectDir>/cmake/ProjectDependenciesSetup.cmake`_.

#
# Below, we change the value of user cache values like
# ${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_${PACKAGE_NAME},
# ${PACKAGE_NAME}_ENABLE_TESTS, and ${PACKAGE_NAME}_ENABLE_EXAMPLES by
# just setting them to regular variables that live in the top scope
# instead of putting them back in the cache.  That means that they are
# used as global variables but we don't want to disturb the cache
# since that would change the behavior for future invocations of cmake
# (which is very confusing).  Because of this, these macros must all
# be called from the top-level ${PROJECT_NAME} CMakeLists.txt file and
# macros must call macros as not to change the variable scope.
#
# I had to do it this way in order to be able to get the right behavior which
# is:
#
# 1) Override the value of these variables in all CMake processing
#
# 2) Avoid changing the user cache values because that would be confusing and
# would make it hard to change package enables/disable later without blowing
# away the cache
