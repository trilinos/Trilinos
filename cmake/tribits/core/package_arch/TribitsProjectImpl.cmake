# @MACRO: tribits_project_enable_all()
#
# Process a project where you enable all of the packages by default.
#
# Usage::
#
#   tribits_project_enable_all()
#
# This macro just sets the global cache var
# `${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES`_ to ``ON`` by default then calls
# `tribits_project()`_.  That is all.  This macro is generally used for
# TriBITS projects that have just a single package or by default just want to
# enable all packages.  This is especially useful when you have a TriBITS
# project with just a single package.
