# @MACRO: tribits_pkg_export_cache_var()
#
# Macro that registers a package-level cache var to be exported in the
# ``<Package>Config.cmake`` file
#
# Usage::
#
#   tribits_pkg_export_cache_var(<cacheVarName>)
#
# where ``<cacheVarName>`` must be the name of a cache variable (or an error
# will occur).
#
# NOTE: This will also export this variable to the
# ``<Package><Spkg>Config.cmake`` file for every enabled subpackage (if this
# is called from a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file of a top-level package that has
# subpackages).  That way, any top-level package cache vars are provided by
# any of the subpackages' ``<Package><Spkg>Config.cmake`` files.

# Asset that a cache variable and a possible local variable (if it exists)

#
# Usage::

#   tribits_assert_cache_and_local_vars_same_value(<cacheVarName>)
#
# If the local var ``<cacheVarName>`` and the cache var ``<cacheVarName>``
# both exist but have different values, then ``message(SEND_ERROR ...)`` is
# called with an informative error message.
