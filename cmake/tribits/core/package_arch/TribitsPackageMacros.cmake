#
# @MACRO: TRIBITS_PACKAGE_DECL()
#
# Macro called at the very beginning of a package's top-level
# `<packageDir>/CMakeLists.txt`_ file when a package has subpackages.
#
# Usage::
#
#   TRIBITS_PACKAGE_DECL(
#     <packageName>
#     [ENABLE_SHADOWING_WARNINGS]
#     [DISABLE_STRONG_WARNINGS]
#     [CLEANED]
#     [DISABLE_CIRCULAR_REF_DETECTION_FAILURE]
#     )
#
# The arguments are:
#
#   ``<packageName>``
#
#     Gives the name of the Package, mostly just for checking and
#     documentation purposes.  This must match the name of the package
#     provided in the `<repoDir>/PackagesList.cmake`_ or an error is issued.
#
#   ``ENABLE_SHADOWING_WARNINGS``
#
#     If specified, then shadowing warnings for the package's sources will be
#     turned on for supported platforms/compilers.  The default is for
#     shadowing warnings to be turned off.  Note that this can be overridden
#     globally by setting the cache variable
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_SHADOWING_WARNINGS``.
#
#   ``DISABLE_STRONG_WARNINGS``
#
#     If specified, then all strong warnings for the package's sources will be
#     turned off, if they are not already turned off by global cache
#     variables.  Strong warnings are turned on by default in development
#     mode.
#
#   ``CLEANED``
#
#     If specified, then warnings will be promoted to errors for compiling the
#     package's sources for all defined warnings.
#
#   ``DISABLE_CIRCULAR_REF_DETECTION_FAILURE``
#
#     If specified, then the standard grep looking for RCPNode circular
#     references in `TRIBITS_ADD_TEST()`_ and `TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST()`_
#     that causes tests to fail will be disabled.  Note that if these warnings
#     are being produced then it means that the test is leaking memory and
#     user like may also be leaking memory.
#
# There are several side-effects of calling this macro:
#
# * The variables ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIB_TARGETS`` (lists all of the package's
#   targets) and ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_ALL_TARGETS`` (lists all of the package's
#   libraries) and are initialized to empty.
#
# * The local variables ``PACKAGE_SOURCE_DIR`` and ``PACKAGE_BINARY_DIR`` are
#   set for this package's use in its CMakeLists.txt files.
#
# * Package-specific compiler options are set up in package-scope (i.e., the
#   package's subdirs) in ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAG``.
#
# * This packages's cmake subdir ``${PACKAGE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake`` is added to
#   ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`` locally so that the package's try-compile modules
#   can be read in with just a raw ``INCLUDE()`` leaving off the full path and
#   the ``*.cmake`` extension.
#
# If the package does not have subpackages, just call `TRIBITS_PACKAGE()`_
# which calls this macro.

# carefully studying all of the code and issues that modify these variables!

# ToDo: Write some good unit tests that pin down the behavior of all of this!
