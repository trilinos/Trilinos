# @MACRO: tribits_project()
#
# Processes a `TriBITS Project`_'s files and configures its software which is
# called from the project's top-level `<projectDir>/CMakeLists.txt`_ file.
#
# Usage::
#
#   tribits_project()
#
# This macro requires that the variable `PROJECT_NAME`_ be defined before
# calling this macro.  All default values for project settings should be set
# before calling this macro (see `TriBITS Global Project Settings`_).  Also,
# the variable `${PROJECT_NAME}_TRIBITS_DIR`_ must be set as well.
#
# This macro then adds all of the necessary paths to ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`` and
# then performs all processing of the TriBITS project files (see `Full TriBITS
# Project Configuration`_).
#
macro(tribits_project)
  tribits_project_impl(${ARGN})
endmacro()

# Note, this is just a shell of a macro that calls the real implementation
# tribits_project_impl().  This allows someone to set
# ${PROJECT_NAME}_TRIBITS_DIR in the env and point to a different Tribits
# implementation to test before snapshoting.
