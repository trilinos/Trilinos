# @FUNCTION: TRIBITS_TPL_ALLOW_PRE_FIND_PACKAGE()
#
# Function that determines if a TriBITS find module file
# ``FindTPL<tplName>.cmake`` is allowed to call ``FIND_PACKAGE(<tplName>
# ...)`` before calling `TRIBITS_TPL_FIND_INCLUDE_DIRS_AND_LIBRARIES()`_.
#
# Usage::
#
#   TRIBITS_TPL_ALLOW_PRE_FIND_PACKAGE( <tplName>
#     <allowPackagePrefindOut> )
#
# The required arguments are:
#
#   ``<tplName>`` : The input name of the TriBITS TPL (e.g. ``HDF5``).
#
#   ``<allowPackagePrefindOut>`` : Name of a variable which will be set to
#   ``TRUE`` on output if ``FIND_PACKAGE(<tplName> ...)`` should be called to
#   find the TPL ``<tplName>`` or ``FALSE`` if it should not be called.
#
# This function will set ``<allowPackagePrefindOut>`` to ``FALSE`` if any of
# the variables ``TPL_<tplName>_INCLUDE_DIRS``, ``${TPL_<tplName>_LIBRARIES``,
# or ``TPL_<tplName>_LIBRARY_DIRS`` are set.  This allows the user to override
# the search for the library components and just specify the absolute
# locations.  The function will also set ``<allowPackagePrefindOut>`` to
# ``FALSE`` if ``<tplName>_INCLUDE_DIRS``, ``<tplName>_LIBRARY_NAMES``, or
# ``<tplName>_LIBRARY_DIRS`` is set and ``<tplName>_FORCE_PRE_FIND_PACKAGE`` is
# set to ``FALSE``.  Otherwise, if ``<tplName>_FORCE_PRE_FIND_PACKAGE`` is set
# to ``TRUE``, the function will not return ``FALSE`` for
# ``<allowPackagePrefindOut>`` no matter what the values of
# ``<tplName>_INCLUDE_DIRS``, ``<tplName>_LIBRARY_NAMES``, or
# ``<tplName>_LIBRARY_DIRS``.
#
# The variable ``<tplName>_FORCE_PRE_FIND_PACKAGE`` is needed to allow users
# (or the ``FindTPL<tplName>.cmake`` module itself) to avoid name clashes with
# the variables ``<tplName>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` or ``<tplName>_LIBRARY_DIRS`` in
# the usage of ``FIND_PACKAGE(<tplName> ...)`` because a lot of default
# ``Find<tplName>.cmake`` modules also use these variables.  This function
# sets ``<tplName>_FORCE_PRE_FIND_PACKAGE`` as a cache variable with default
# value ``FALSE`` to maintain backward compatibility with existing
# ``FindTPL<tplName>.cmake`` modules.
#
# See `How to use FIND_PACKAGE() for a TriBITS TPL`_ for details in how to use
# this function to create a ``FindTPL<tplName>.cmake`` module file.

#
# @FUNCTION: TRIBITS_TPL_FIND_INCLUDE_DIRS_AND_LIBRARIES()
#
# Function that sets up cache variables for users to specify where to find a
# `TriBITS TPL`_'s headers and libraries.  This function is typically called
# inside of a ``FindTPL<tplName>.cmake`` moulde file (see
# `${TPL_NAME}_FINDMOD`_).
#
# Usage::
#
#   TRIBITS_TPL_FIND_INCLUDE_DIRS_AND_LIBRARIES(
#     <tplName>
#     [REQUIRED_HEADERS <header1> <header2> ...]
#     [MUST_FIND_ALL_HEADERS]
#     [REQUIRED_LIBS_NAMES <libname1> <libname2> ...]
#     [MUST_FIND_ALL_LIBS]
#     [NO_PRINT_ENABLE_SUCCESS_FAIL]
#     )
#
# This function can be called to specify/require header files and include
# directories and/or a list of libraries.
#
# The input arguments to this function are:
#
#   ``<tplName>``
#
#     Name of the TPL that is listed in a `<repoDir>/TPLsList.cmake`_ file.
#
#   ``REQUIRED_HEADERS``
#
#     List of header files that are searched in order to find the TPL's
#     include directories files using ``FIND_PATH()``. 
#
#   ``MUST_FIND_ALL_HEADERS``
#
#     If set, then all of the header files listed in ``REQUIRED_HEADERS`` must
#     be found in order for ``TPL_<tplName>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` to be defined.
#
#   ``REQUIRED_LIBS_NAMES``
#
#     List of libraries that are searched for when looking for the TPL's
#     libraries using ``FIND_LIBRARY()``.  This list can be overridden by the
#     user by setting ``<tplName>_LIBRARY_DIRS`` (see below).
#
#   ``MUST_FIND_ALL_LIBS``
#
#     If set, then all of the library files listed in ``REQUIRED_LIBS_NAMES``
#     must be found or the TPL is considered not found!  If the global cache
#     var ``<Project>_MUST_FIND_ALL_TPL_LIBS`` is set to ``TRUE``, then this
#     is turned on as well.  WARNING: The default is not to require finding
#     all of the listed libs.  This is to maintain backward compatibility with
#     some older ``FindTPL<tplName>.cmake`` modules.
#
#   ``NO_PRINT_ENABLE_SUCCESS_FAIL``
#
#      If set, then the final success/fail will not be printed
#
# This function implements the TPL find behavior described in `Enabling
# support for an optional Third-Party Library (TPL)`_.
#
# The following (cache) variables, if set, will be used by that this function:
#
#   ``<tplName>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` (type ``PATH``)
#
#     List of paths to search first for header files defined in
#     ``REQUIRED_HEADERS``.
#
#   ``<tplName>_LIBRARY_DIRS`` (type ``PATH``)
#
#     The list of directories to search first for libraries defined in
#     ``REQUIRED_LIBS_NAMES``.  If, for some reason, no libraries should be
#     linked in for this particular configuration, then setting
#     ``<tplName>_LIBRARY_DIRS=OFF`` will 
#
#   ``<tplName>_LIBRARY_NAMES`` (type ``STRING``)
#
#     List of library names to be looked for instead of what is specified in
#     ``REQUIRED_LIBS_NAMES``.
#
# This function sets global variables to return state so it can be called from
# anywhere in the call stack.  The following cache variables are defined that
# are intended for the user to set and/or use:
#
#   ``TPL_<tplName>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` (type ``PATH``)
#
#     A list of common-separated full directory paths that contain the TPL's
#     header files.  If this variable is set before calling this function,
#     then no headers are searched for and this variable will be assumed to
#     have the correct list of header paths.
#
#   ``TPL_<tplName>_LIBRARIES`` (type ``FILEPATH``)
#
#     A list of commons-separated full library names (i.e. output from
#     ``FIND_LIBRARY()``) for all of the libraries found for the TPL.  If this
#     variable is set before calling this function, then no libraries are
#     searched for and this variable will be assumed to have the correct list
#     of libraries to link to.
#
#   ``TPL_<tplName>_NOT_FOUND`` (type ``BOOL``)
#
#     Will be set to ``ON`` if all of the parts of the TPL could not be found.
#
# ToDo: Document the behavior of this function for finding headers and
# libraries and when a find is successful and when it is not.
#
# Note, if ``TPL_TENTATIVE_ENABLE_<tplName>=ON``, then if all of the parts of
# the TPL can't be found, then ``TPL_ENABLE_<tplName>`` will be (forced) set
# to ``OFF`` in the cache.  See `TRIBITS_TPL_TENTATIVELY_ENABLE()`_.

#
# @FUNCTION: TRIBITS_TPL_TENTATIVELY_ENABLE()
#
# Function that sets up for an optionally enabled TPL that is attempted to be
# enabled but will be disabled if all of the parts are not found.
#
# Usage::
#
#   TRIBITS_TPL_TENTATIVELY_ENABLE(<tplName>)
# 
# This function can be called from any CMakeLists.txt file to put a TPL in
# tentative enable mode.  But typically, it is called from an SE Pakcage's
# `<packageDir>/cmake/Dependencies.cmake`_ file (see `How to tentatively
# enable a TPL`_).
#
# This should only be used for optional TPLs.  It will not work correctly for
# required TPLs because any enabled packages that require this TPL will not be
# disabled and instead will fail to configure or fail to build.
#
# All this function does is to force set ``TPL_ENABLE_<tplName>=ON`` if it has
# not already been set, and sets ``TPL_TENTATIVE_ENABLE_<tplName>=ON`` in the
# cache.
#
# NOTE: This function will only tentatively enable a TPL it its enable has not
# be explicitly set on input, i.e. if ``-D TPL_ENABLE_<tplName>=""``.  If the
# TPL has been explicitly enabled (i.e. ``-D TPL_ENABLE_<tplName>=ON``) or
# disabled (i.e. ``-D TPL_ENABLE_<tplName>=OFF``), then this function has no
# effect and the TPL will be unconditionally enabled or disabled.
#

    # The TPL's enable status has not been set so tentatively enable it.
