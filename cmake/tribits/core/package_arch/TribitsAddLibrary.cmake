#
# **Formal Arguments (tribits_add_library())**
#
#   ``<libBaseName>``
#
#     Required base name of the library.  The name of the actual library name
#     will be prefixed by ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_LIBRARY_NAME_PREFIX}`` to
#     produce::
#     
#       <libTargetName> = ${${PROJECT_NAME}_LIBRARY_NAME_PREFIX}<libBaseName>
#
#     This is the name passed to ``add_library(<libTargetName> ...)``.  The
#     name is *not* prefixed by the package name.  CMake will of course add
#     any standard prefix or post-fix to the library file name appropriate for
#     the platform and if this is a static or shared library build (e.g. on
#     Linux prefix = ``'lib'``, postfix = ``'.so'`` for shared lib and postfix
#     = ``'.a'`` static lib) (see documentation for the built-in CMake command
#     ``add_library()``.
#
#   ``HEADERS <h0> <h1> ...``
#
#     List of public header files for using this library.  By default, these
#     header files are assumed to be in the current source directory.  They
#     can also contain the relative path or absolute path to the files if they
#     are not in the current source directory.  This list of headers is passed
#     into ``add_library(...)`` as well (which is not strictly needed but is
#     helpful for some build tools, like MS Visual Studio).  By default, these
#     headers will be installed (see `Install Targets
#     (tribits_add_library())`_).
#
#   ``HEADERS_INSTALL_SUBDIR <headerssubdir>``
#
#     Optional subdirectory that the headers will be installed under the
#     standard installation directory.  If ``<headerssubdir>!=""``, then the
#     headers will be installed under
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR}/<headerssubdir>``.  Otherwise,
#     they will be installed under ``${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR}/``.
#     `Install Targets (tribits_add_library())`_.
#
#   ``NOINSTALLHEADERS <nih0> <hih1> ...``
#
#     List of private header files which are used by this library. These
#     headers are not installed and do not needed to be passed in for any
#     purpose other than to pass them into ``add_library()`` as some build
#     tools like to have these listed (e.g. MS Visual Studio).
#
#   ``SOURCES <src0> <src1> ...``
#
#     List of source files passed into ``add_library()`` that are compiled
#     into header files and included in the library.  The compiler used to
#     compile the files is determined automatically based on the file
#     extension (see CMake documentation for ``add_library()``).
#
#   ``DEPLIBS <deplib0> <deplib1> ...``
#
#     List of dependent libraries that are built in the current package that
#     this library is dependent on.  These libraries are passed into
#     ``target_link_libraries(<libTargetName> ...)`` so that CMake knows about
#     the dependency structure of the libraries within this package.
#     **NOTE:** One must **not** list libraries in other upstream `TriBITS
#     Packages`_ or libraries built externally from this TriBITS CMake project
#     in ``DEPLIBS``.  The TriBITS system automatically handles linking to
#     libraries in upstream TriBITS packages.  External libraries need to be
#     listed in the ``IMPORTEDLIBS`` argument instead if they are not already
#     specified automatically using a `TriBITS TPL`_.
#
#   ``IMPORTEDLIBS <ideplib0> <ideplib1> ...``
#
#     List of dependent libraries built externally from this TriBITS CMake
#     project.  These libraries are passed into
#     ``target_link_libraries(<libTargetName> ...)`` so that CMake knows about
#     the dependency.  However, note that external libraries are often better
#     handled as `TriBITS TPLs`_.  A well constructed TriBITS package and
#     library should never have to use this option!  So far, the only case
#     where ``IMPORTEDLIBS`` has been shown to be necessary is to pass in the
#     standard C math library ``m``.  In every other case, a TriBITS TPL
#     should be used instead.
#
#   ``STATIC`` or ``SHARED``
#
#     If ``STATIC`` is passed in, then a static library will be created
#     independent of the value of ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS``.  If ``SHARED`` is
#     passed in, then a shared library will be created independent of the
#     value of ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS``.  If neither ``STATIC`` or ``SHARED`` are
#     passed in, then a shared library will be created if
#     ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` evaluates to true, otherwise and a static library
#     will be created.  If both ``STATIC`` and ``SHARED`` are passed in (which
#     is obviously a mistake), then a shared library will be created.
#     WARNING: Once you mark a library with ``STATIC``, then all of the
#     downstream libraries in the current package and all downstream packages
#     must also be also be marked with ``STATIC``.  That is because,
#     generally, one can not link a link a static lib against a downstream
#     shared lib since that is not portable (but can be done on some platforms
#     if, for example, ``-fPIC`` is specified).  So be careful to use
#     ``STATIC`` in all downstream libraries!
#
#   ``TESTONLY``
#
#     If passed in, then ``<libTargetName>`` will **not** be added to
#     ``${PACKAGE_NAME}_LIBRARIES`` and an install target for the library will
#     not be added.  In this case, the current include directories will be set
#     in the global variable ``<libTargetName>_INCLUDE_DIR`` which will be
#     used in `tribits_add_executable()`_ when a test-only library is linked
#     in through its ``DEPLIBS`` argument.  Also, the custom property
#     ``TRIBITS_TESTONLY_LIB`` will be set to ``TRUE`` which will ensure that
#     this library will not be added to the ``${PACKAGE_NAME}::all_libs``
#     target.
#
#   ``NO_INSTALL_LIB_OR_HEADERS``
#
#     If specified, then no install targets will be added for the library
#     ``<libTargetName>`` or the header files listed in ``HEADERS``.
#
#   ``CUDALIBRARY``
#
#     If specified then ``cuda_add_library()`` is used instead of
#     ``add_library()`` where ``cuda_add_library()`` is assumed to be defined
#     by the standard ``FindCUDA.cmake`` module as processed using the
#     standard TriBITS ``FindTPLCUDA.cmake`` file (see `Standard TriBITS
#     TPLs`_).  For this option to work, this package must have an enabled
#     direct or indirect dependency on the TriBITS CUDA TPL or a
#     configure-time error may occur about not knowing about
#     ``cuda_all_library()``.
#
#   ``ADDED_LIB_TARGET_NAME_OUT <libTargetName>``
#
#     If specified, then on output the variable ``<libTargetName>`` will be
#     set with the name of the library passed to ``add_library()``.  Having
#     this name allows the calling ``CMakeLists.txt`` file access and set
#     additional target properties (see `Additional Library and Source File
#     Properties (tribits_add_library())`_).
#
# .. _Include Directories (tribits_add_library()):
#
# **Include Directories (tribits_add_library())**
#
# Any base directories for the header files listed in the arguments
# ``HEADERS`` or ``NOINSTALLHEADERS`` should be passed into the standard CMake
# command ``include_directories()`` **before** calling this function.  For
# example, a CMakeLists.txt file will look like::
#
#   ...
#
#   tribits_configure_file(${PACKAGE_NAME}_config.h)
#   configure_file(...)
#
#   ...
#
#   include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
#   include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})
#
#   ...
#
#   tribits_add_library( <libName>
#     SOURCES
#       <src0>.c
#       <subdir0>/<src1>.cpp
#       <subdir1>/<src2>.F90
#       ...
#     HEADERS
#        <header0>.h
#        <subdir0>/<header1>.hpp
#         ...
#     NONINSTALLHEADERS <header2>.hpp <header3>.hpp ...
#     ...
#     )
#
# The include of ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}`` is needed for any generated
# header files (e.g. using raw ``configure_file()`` or
# `tribits_configure_file()`_) or any generated Fortran ``*.mod`` module files
# generated as a byproduct of compiling F90+ source files (that contain one or
# more Fortran module declarations).
#
# The function ``tribits_add_library()`` will grab the list of all of the
# include directories in scope from prior calls to ``include_directories()``
# and will add this to the generated library target using
# ``target_link_libraries()`` so that they get propagated downstream as well.
#
# .. _Install Targets (tribits_add_library()):
#
# **Install Targets (tribits_add_library())**
#
# By default, an install target for the library is created using
# ``install(TARGETS <libTargetName> ...)`` to install into the directory
# ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/lib/`` (actual install directory is given by
# ``${PROJECT}_INSTALL_LIB_DIR``, see `Setting the install prefix`_).
# However, this install target will not get created if
# `${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_LIBRARIES_AND_HEADERS`_ is ``FASLE`` and
# ``BUILD_SHARD_LIBS=OFF``.  But when ``BUILD_SHARD_LIBS=ON``, the install
# target will get added.  Also, this install target will *not* get added if
# ``TESTONLY`` or ``NO_INSTALL_LIB_OR_HEADERS`` are passed in.
#
# By default, an install target for the headers listed in ``HEADERS`` will get
# added using ``install(FILES <h0> <h1> ...)``, but only if ``TESTONLY`` and
# ``NO_INSTALL_LIB_OR_HEADERS`` are not passed in as well.  Also, the install
# target for the headers will not get added if
# `${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_LIBRARIES_AND_HEADERS`_ is ``FASLE``.  If this
# install target is added, then the headers get installed into the flat
# directory ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR}/`` (default is
# ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/``, see `Setting the install prefix`_).
# If ``HEADERS_INSTALL_SUBDIR`` is set, then the headers will be installed
# under ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_INSTALL_INCLUDE_DIR}/<headerssubdir>/``.
#
# Note that an install target will *not* get created for the headers listed in
# ``NOINSTALLHEADERS``.
#
# .. _Additional Library and Source File Properties (tribits_add_library()):
#
# **Additional Library and Source File Properties (tribits_add_library())**
#
# Once ``add_library(<libTargetName> ... <src0> <src1> ...)`` is called, one
# can set and change properties on the ``<libTargetName>`` library target
# using the built-in CMake command ``set_target_properties()`` as well as set
# and change properties on any of the source files listed in ``SOURCES`` using
# the built-in CMake command ``set_source_file_properties()`` just like in any
# CMake project.  For example::
#
#   tribits_add_library( somelib ...
#     ADDED_LIB_TARGET_NAME_OUT  somelib_TARGET_NAME )
#
#   set_target_properties( ${somelib_TARGET_NAME}
#     PROPERTIES  LINKER_LANGUAGE  CXX )
#
# .. _Miscellaneous Notes (tribits_add_library()):
#
# **Miscellaneous Notes (tribits_add_library())**
#
# When the file ``Version.cmake`` exists and the CMake variables
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_VERSION`` and ``${PROJECT_NAME}_MAJOR_VERSION`` are
# defined, then produced shared libraries will be given the standard SOVERSION
# symlinks (see `<projectDir>/Version.cmake`_).
#
# **WARNING:** Do **NOT** use the built-in CMake command ``add_definitions()``
# to add defines ``-D<someDefine>`` to the compile command line that will
# affect any of the header files in the package!  These CMake-added defines
# are only set locally in this directory and child directories.  These defines
# will **NOT** be set when code in peer directories (e.g. a downstream TriBITS
# packages) compiles that may include these header files.  To add defines that
# affect header files, please use a configured header file (see
# `tribits_configure_file()`_).
