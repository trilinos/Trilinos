# @FUNCTION: MESSAGE_WRAPPER()
#
# Function that wraps the standard CMake/CTest ``MESSAGE()`` function call in
# order to allow unit testing to intercept the output.
#
# Usage::
#
#   MESSAGE_WRAPPER(...)
#
# This function takes exactly the same arguments as built-in ``MESSAGE()``
# function.  However, when the variable ``MESSAGE_WRAPPER_UNIT_TEST_MODE`` is
# set to ``TRUE``, then this function will not call ``MESSAGE(...)`` but
# instead will prepend set to the global variable ``MESSAGE_WRAPPER_INPUT``
# the input argument that would have gone to ``MESSAGE()``.  To capture just
# this call's input, first call::
#
#   GLOBAL_NULL_SET(MESSAGE_WRAPPER_INPUT)
#
# before calling this function (or the functions/macros that call this
# function).
#
# This function allows one to unit test other user-defined CMake macros and
# functions that call this function to catch error conditions without stopping
# the CMake program.  Otherwise, this is used to capture print messages to
# verify that they say the right thing.
