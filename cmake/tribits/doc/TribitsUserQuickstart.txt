Introduction
===============

This document is a generic guide for users of a TriBITS project who need to configure, build, install, and test software that uses the CMake-based TriBITS system.  The generic <Project>_ and <PROJECT>_ prefix is used for regular-case and upper-case project names.


Getting set up to use CMake
==============================

Installing a binary release of CMake [casual Trilinos users]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download and install the binary (currently version 2.8 is required) from:

  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html


Installing CMake from source [Trilinos developers and experienced users]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have access to the Trilinos CVS repository, then install CMake with::

  $ $TRILINOS_HOME/cmake/python/install-cmake.py --install-dir=INSTALL_BASE_DIR

This will result in cmake and related CMake tools being installed in
INSTALL_BASE_DIR/bin.

Getting help for installing CMake with this script::

  $ $TRILINOS_HOME/cmake/python/install-cmake.py --help

NOTE: you will want to read the help message about how to use sudo to
install in a privileged location (like the default /usr/local/bin).


Getting Help
===============

Finding CMake help at the website
---------------------------------

  http://www.cmake.org

Building CMake help locally
---------------------------
::

$ cmake --help-full cmake.help.html

(Open your web browser to the file cmake.help.html)


Configuring (Makefile Generator)
===================================

Setting up a build directory
-----------------------------
::

  $ mkdir SOME_BUILD_DIR
  $ cd SOME_BUILD_DIR

NOTE: You can create a build directory from any location you would like.  It
can be a sub-directory of the Trilinos base source directory or anywhere
else.

NOTE: If you mistakenly try to configure for an in-source build (e.g. with
'cmake .') you will get an error message and instructions on how to resolve
the problem by deleting the generated CMakeCache.txt file (and other
generated files) and then follow directions on how to create a different
build directory as shown above.

Basic configuration of Trilinos
--------------------------------

a) [Recommended] Create a 'do-configure' script such as::

    EXTRA_ARGS=$@
    
    cmake \
      -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=DEBUG \
      -D Trilinos_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON \
      $EXTRA_ARGS \
      ${TRILINOS_HOME}

  and then run it with::

    ./do-configure [OTHER OPTIONS] -DTrilinos_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>=ON

  where <TRIBITS_PACKAGE> is Epetra, AztecOO, etc. and TRILINOS_HOME is et
  to the Trilinos source base directory (or your can just give it
  explicitly).

  See `Trilinos/sampleScripts/*cmake` for real examples.

b) [Recommended] Create a CMake file fragment and point to it.

  Create a do-configure script like::

    EXTRA_ARGS=$@
    
    cmake \
      -D Trilinos_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_FILE:FILEPATH=MyConfigureOptions.cmake \
      -D Trilinos_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON \
      $EXTRA_ARGS \
      ${TRILINOS_HOME}
     
  where MyConfigureOptions.cmake might look like::

    SET(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE DEBUG CACHE STRING "" FORCE)
    SET(Trilinos_ENABLE_CHECKED_STL ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
    SET(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
    ...

  Using a configuration fragment file allows for better reuse of configure
  options across different configure scripts and better version control of
  configure options.

  NOTE: You can actually pass in a list of configuration fragment files
  which will be read in the order they are given.

  NOTE: If you do not use 'FORCE' shown above, then the option can be
  overridden on the cmake command line with -D options.  Also, if you don't
  use 'FORCE' then the option will not be set if it is already set in the
  case (e.g. by another configuration fragment file prior in the list).

c) Using ccmake to configure

  ::

    $ ccmake $TRILINOS_HOME

d) Using the QT CMake configuration GUI:

  On systems where the QT CMake GUI is installed (e.g. Windows) the CMake GUI
  can be a nice way to configure Trilinos if you are a user.  To make your
  configuration easily repeatable, you might want to create a fragment file
  and just load it by setting Trilinos_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_FILE (see above) in
  the GUI.

Selecting the list of packages to enable
----------------------------------------

a) Configuring a package(s) along with all of the packages it can use:

    $ ./do-configure \
       -D Trilinos_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>:BOOL=ON \
       -D Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON \
       -D Trilinos_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON

  NOTE: This set of arguments allows a user to turn on <TRIBITS_PACKAGE> as well as
  all packages that <TRIBITS_PACKAGE> can use.  However, tests and examples will
  only be turned on for <TRIBITS_PACKAGE> (or any other packages specifically
  enabled).

b) Configuring Trilinos to test all effects of changing a given package(s)::

    $ ./do-configure \
       -D Trilinos_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>:BOOL=ON \
       -D Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON \
       -D Trilinos_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON

  NOTE: The above set of arguments will result in package <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>
  and all packages that depend on <TRIBITS_PACKAGE> to be enabled and have all
  of their tests turned on.  Tests will not be enabled in packages that do not
  depend on <TRIBITS_PACKAGE> in this case.  This speeds up and robustifies
  pre-checkin testing.

c) Configuring to build all stable packages with tests and examples::

    $ ./do-configure \
       -D Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON \
       -D Trilinos_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON

  NOTE: Specific packages can be disabled with
  Trilinos_ENABLE_<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>:BOOL=OFF.  This will also disable all
  packages that depend on <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>.

  NOTE: All examples are enabled by default when setting
  Trilinos_ENABLE_TESTS:BOOL=ON.

  NOTE: By default, setting Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES=ON only enables
  Primary Stable Code.  To have this also enable all secondary stable code,
  you must also you must set Trilinos_ENABLE_SECONDARY_STABLE_CODE=ON.

d) Disable a package and all its dependencies::

      $ ./do-configure \
         -D Trilinos_ENABLE_<PACKAGE_A>:BOOL=ON \
         -D Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON \
         -D Trilinos_ENABLE_<PACKAGE_B>:BOOL=OFF

   Above, this will enable <PACKAGE_A> and all of the packages that it
   depends on except for <PACKAGE_B> and all of its forward dependencies.
   For example, if you run::

     $ ./do-configure \
        -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Thyra:BOOL=ON \
        -D Trilinos_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON \
        -D Trilinos_ENABLE_Epetra:BOOL=OFF

   The packages Thyra, RTOp, and Teuchos will be enabled, but the packages
   Epetra, EpetraExt will be disabled.

e) Removing all package enables in the Cache

  ::

    $ ./-do-confiugre -D Trilinos_UNENABLE_ENABLED_PACKAGES:BOOL=TRUE

  This option will set to empty '' all package enables, leaving all other
  cache variables as they are.  You can then reconfigure with a new set of
  package enables for a different set of packages.  This allows you to avoid
  more expensive configure time checks and to preserve other cache variables
  that you have set and don't want to loose.

Selecting compiler and linker options
-------------------------------------

NOTE: The Trilinos CMake build system will set up default compile options for
GCC ('GNU') in development mode on order to help produce portable code.

a) Configuring to build with default debug or release compiler flags:

  To build a debug version, pass into 'cmake'::

    -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=DEBUG

  This will result in default debug flags getting passed to the compiler.

  To build a release (optimized) version, pass into 'cmake'::

    -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=RELEASE

  This will result in optimized flags getting passed to the compiler.

b) Adding arbitrary compiler flags but keeping other default flags:

  To append arbitrary compiler flags that apply to all build types,
  configure with::

    -DCMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS:STRING="<EXTRA_COMPILER_OPTIONS>"

  where <LANG> = C, CXX, Fortran and <EXTRA_COMPILER_OPTIONS> are your extra
  compiler options like "-DSOME_MACRO_TO_DEFINE -funroll-loops".  These
  options will get appended to other internally defined compiler option and
  therefore override them.

  NOTES:

  1) Setting CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS will override but will not replace any other
  internally set flags in CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS defined by the Trilinos CMake
  system because these flags will come after those set internally.  To get
  rid of these default flags, see below.

  2) For each compiler type (e.g. C, C++ (CXX), Fortran), CMake passes
  compiler options to the compiler in the order::

    CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS   CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>

  where <LANG> = C, CXX, or Fortran and <CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE> = DEBUG or
  RELEASE.  THEREFORE: The options in CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>
  come after and override those in CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS!.

  3) CMake defines default CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE> values that
  are overridden by the Trilinos CMake build system for GCC ("GNU")
  compilers in development mode (e.g. Trilinos_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=ON).
  This is mostly to provide greater control over the Trilinos development
  environment.  This means that users setting the CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS will
  *not* override the internally set debug or release flags in
  CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE> which come after on the compile
  line.  Therefore, setting CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS should only be used for
  options that will not get overridden by the internally-set debug or
  release compiler flags in CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>.  However,
  setting CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS will work well for adding extra compiler
  defines (e.g. -DSOMETHING) for example.

  WARNING: Any options that you set through the cache variable
  CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE> (where <CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE> = DEBUG or
  RELEASE) will get overridden in the Trilinos CMake system for GNU
  compilers in development mode so don't try to manually set
  CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE>!

c) Overriding debug/release compiler options:

  To pass in compiler options that override the default debug options use::

    -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG_OVERRIDE:STRING="-g -O1" \
    -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_DEBUG_OVERRIDE:STRING="-g -O1"

  and to override default release options use::

    -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS_RELEASE_OVERRIDE:STRING="-04 -funroll-loops" \
    -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE_OVERRIDE:STRING="-03 -fexceptions"

  NOTES: The new CMake variable CMAKE_${LANG}_FLAGS_${BUILDTYPE}_OVERRIDE is
  used and not CMAKE_${LANG}_FLAGS_${BUILDTYPE} because the Trilinos CMake
  wrappers redefine CMAKE_${LANG}_FLAGS_${BUILDTYPE} and it is impossible to
  determine if the value defined is determined by a user or by CMake.

d) Appending arbitrary link flags to every executable:

  In order to append any set of arbitrary link flags to your executables use::

    -D Trilinos_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS:STRING="$EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS"

  Above, you can pass any type of library and they will always be the last
  libraries listed, even after all of the TPL.

  NOTE: This is how you must set extra libraries like Fortran libraries and
  MPI libraries (when using raw compilers).  Please only use this variable
  as a last resort.

  NOTE: You must only pass in libraries in Trilinos_EXTRA_LINK_FLAGS and
  *not* arbitrary linker flags.  To pass in extra linker flags that are not
  libraries, use the built-in CMake variable CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS instead.

e) Turning off strong warnings for individual packages:

  To turn off strong warnings (for all langauges) for a given TriBITS
  package, set::

    -D <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_DISABLE_STRONG_WARNINGS:BOOL=ON

  This will only affect the compilation of the sources for
  <TRIBITS_PACKAGES>, not warnings generated from the header files in
  downstream packages or client code.

f) Overriding all (strong warnings and debug/release) compiler options:

  To override all compiler options, including both strong warning options
  and debug/release options, configure with::

    -D CMAKE_C_FLAGS:STRING="-04 -funroll-loops" \
    -D CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:STRING="-03 -fexceptions" \
    -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=NONE \
    -D Trilinos_ENABLE_STRONG_C_COMPILE_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF \
    -D Trilinos_ENABLE_STRONG_CXX_COMPILE_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF \
    -D Trilinos_ENABLE_SHADOW_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF \
    -D Trilinos_ENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING:BOOL=OFF \
    -D Trilinos_ENABLE_CHECKED_STL:BOOL=OFF \

  NOTE: Options like Trilinos_ENABLE_SHADOW_WARNINGS,
  Trilinos_ENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING, and Trilinos_ENABLE_CHECKED_STL do not
  need to be turned off by default but they are shown above to make it clear
  what other CMake cache variables can add compiler and link arguments.

g) Enable and disable shadowing warnings for all Trilinos packages:

  To enable shadowing warnings for all Trilinos packages (that don't already
  have them turned on) then use::

    -D Trilinos_ENABLE_SHADOW_WARNINGS:BOOL=ON

  To disable shadowing warnings for all Trilinos packages then use::

    -D Trilinos_ENABLE_SHADOW_WARNINGS:BOOL=OFF

  NOTE: The default value is empty '' which lets each Trilinos package
  decide for itself if shadowing warnings will be turned on or off for that
  package.

h) Removing warnings as errors for CLEANED packages:

  To remove the -Werror flag (or some other flag that is set) from being
  applied to compile CLEANED packages like Teuchos, set the following when
  configuring::

    -D Trilinos_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS_FLAGS:STRING=""


Building (Makefile generator)
================================

Building all targets
--------------------
::

  $ make [-jN]

(where N is the number of processes to use)

Discovering what targets are available to build after configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------
::

  $ make help


See all of the targets to build for a package
---------------------------------------------
::

  $ make help | grep <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_

(where <TRIBITS_PACKAGE> = Teuchos, Epetra, NOX, etc.)

or::

   $ cd packages/<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>
   $ make help


Building all of the targets for a package
-----------------------------------------
::

  $ make <TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_all

(where <TRIBITS_PACKAGE> = Teuchos, Epetra, NOX, etc.)

or::

  $ cd packages/<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>
  $ make


Testing with CTest
=====================

[Recommended] Testing using *ctest*
-----------------------------------
::

  $ ctest -j4

(see output in Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log)

NOTE: The -jN argument allows CTest to use more processes to run tests but
will not exceed the max number of processes specified at configure time.

See detailed test output with::

  $ ctest -j4 -VV


Only running tests for a single package
----------------------------------------

Running a single package test::

  $ ctest -j4 -R '^<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_'

(e.g. TRIBITS_PACKAGE = Teuchos, Epetra, etc.)  (see output in
Testing/Temporary/LastTest.log)

or::

  $ cd packages/<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>
  $ ctest -j4


Running a single test with full output to the console::

  $ ctest -R ^FULL_TEST_NAME$ -VV

(e.g. FULL_TEST_NAME = Teuchos_Comm_test, Epetra_MultiVector_test, etc. )


Running memory checking
-----------------------

To run the memory tests for just a single package, from the *base* build
directory, run::

  $ ctest -R '^<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_' -T memcheck

(where <TRIBITS_PACKAGE> = Epetra, NOX etc.).

(see the detailed output in
  ./Testing/Temporary/LastDynamicAnalysis_DATE_TIME.log)

NOTE: If you try to run memory tests from any subdirectories, that does not
seem to work.  You have to run them from the base build directory and then use
-R '^<TRIBITS_PACKAGE>_' with ctest in order to run your packages tests.


Testing using ``make test``
---------------------------
::

  $ make test

NOTE: This is equivalent to just running 'ctest' without any arguments.


Installing
=============

Setting the install prefix at configure time
--------------------------------------------
::

  $ ./do-configure \
     -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/PROJECTS/install/trilinos/mpi/opt

NOTE: The script 'do-configure' is just a simple shell script that calls CMake
as shown above.


Installing after configuration
-------------------------------
::

  $ make install

(will build all of the targets needed before the install)


Uninstall
---------
::

  $ make uninstall


Packaging
============

Creating a tarball of the source tree
--------------------------------------
::

  $ make package_source

NOTE: The above command will tar up *everything* in the source tree (except
for files explicitly excluded in the CMakeLists.txt files) so make sure that
you start with a totally clean source tree before you do this.  Or, you could
build Doxygen documentation first and then tar up Trilinos and that would give
you the source with Doxygen documentation.

NOTE: You can control what gets put into the tarball by setting the cache
variable CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES when configuring with CMake.


Dashboard submissions
========================

You can use the extended CTest scripting system in Trilinos to submit
package-by-package build, test, coverage, memcheck results to the dashboard.

First, configure as normal but add the build and test parallel levels with::

  $ ./do-configure -DCTEST_BUILD_FLAGS:STRING=-j4 \
    -DCTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL:STRING=4 \
    [OTHER OPTIONS]

Then, invoke the build, test and submit with::

  $ make dashboard

This invokes the advanced CTest script
Trilinos/cmake/ctest/experimental_build_test.cmake to do an experimental build
for all of the packages that you have explicitly enabled.  The packages that
are implicitly enabled due to package dependencies are not directly processed
by the experimental_build_test.cmake script.

There are a number of options that you can set in the environment to control
what this script does.  This set of options can be found by doing:

  $ grep 'SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV(' \
      Trilinos/cmake/tribits/ctest/TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake

Currently, this options includes::

  Blah blah blah ...
