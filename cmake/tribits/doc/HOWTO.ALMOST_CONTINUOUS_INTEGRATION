A) Introduction
---------------

The TriBITS system allows for setting up composite meta-builds of large
collections of software pulled in from many different git/TriBITS code
repositories.  The checkin-test.py script is a key tool to enable the testing
of a set of packages in different git/TriBITS repos before pushing to a master
'origin' set of git repos; all in one robust command invocation.

While the checkin-test.py script was originally designed and its default
behavior is to test a set of local commits created by a developer before
pushing changes to one or more (public) git repos, it can also be used to set
up an Almost Continuous Integration (ACI) process to keep these various
git/TriBITS repos in sync thereby integrating the work of various
disconnected development teams and projects.  To use the checkin-test.py for
ACI requires some setup and changing what the script does a little by passing
in additional options that a developer typically never uses.

The basic concept of Almost Continuous Integration (ACI) is defined and
described in the paper

  Bartlett, Roscoe. Integration Strategies for Computational Science &
  Engineering Software.  2009-0655, Second International Workshop on Software
  Engineering for Computational Science and Engineering, 2009

which can be found here:

This HOWTO file describes how to use the checkin-test.py script to implement
an ACI process for a given set of git/TriBITS repositories and also provides a
little background and context behind ACI.


B) Multi-Git/TriBITS Repo Integration Example
---------------------------------------------

In order to set up the context for the ACI process, let's take, for example, a
simple TriBITS project with two extra repositories:

  BaseProj/
      ExtraRepo1
      ExtraRepo2

Here, BaseProj is the base TriBITS project/repository and ExtraRepo1 and
ExtraRepo2 are extra repositories that supply additional TriBITS packages that
are appended to the TriBITS packages defined in BaseProj.  Also, let's assume
that BaseProj, ExtraRepo1, ExtraRepo2 are developed by three different
development teams that all have different funding sources and priorities so
they tend not to work together or consider the other efforts too much when
developing the software.  However, in this example, there is great value in
combining all of this software into a single integrated meta-project.  This
combined meta-build is driven by a 4th integration/development team.  In this
case, the core developers for each of these three different git/TriBITS repos
do not test compatibility with the other git/TriBITS repos when pushing
commits to their own git/TriBITS repos.  This gives three different git repos
on three different machines:

BaseProj main repo:  Pushed to by the core BaseProj team
  url1.gov:/git/BaseProj

ExtraRepo1 main repo:  Pushed to by the core ExtraRepo1 team
  url2.gov:/git/ExtraRepo1

ExtraRepo2 main repo:  Pushed to by the core ExtraRepo2 team
  url3.gov:/git/ExtraRepo2

Because of the independent development processes of these three teams, unless
these development teams maintain 100% backward compatibility w.r.t. the
interfaces and behavior of the combined software, one can not expect at any
time to be able to pull the code from these three different git repos and be
able to successfully build all of the code and have all of the tests pass.
Therefore, how does the 4th integration team expect to be able to build, test,
and possibly extend the combined software?  In this case, the integration
team would set up their own clones of all three git/TriBITS repos on their own
machine such as:

Integration project mirrored git repos:
  url4.gov:/git/BaseProj
  url4.gov:/git/ExtraRepo1
  url4.gov:/git/ExtraRepo2

Once an initial collaboration effort between the integration team and the
three other development teams is able to get a version of all three
git/TriBITS repos to work correctly in the combined meta-project, these
versions (assume the master branches) would be pushed to the git repos on the
git integration server url4.gov.  The state where the TriBITS packages in the
three different git/TriBITS repos in the master branch on url4.gov all work
together correctly constitutes the initial condition for the ACI process
described below.  From that initial condition, the ACI processes ensure that
updates of the git/TriBITS repos on url4.gov do not break any builds or tests
of the integrated software.

We will use the update of the git/TriBITS ExtraRepo1 repo keeping the other
two git/TriBITS repos BaseProj and ExtraRepo2 constant as the ACI use case in
order to describe how to set up an ACI process using the checkin-test.py
script.


C) Local Sync Git Repo Setup
----------------------------

In order to set up an ACI process for the multi-git/TriBITS repo example
outlined above, first local repos are created by cloning the repos on the
integration server url4.gov as follows (all of which become 'origin'):

$ cd $SYNC_BASE_DIR
$ git clone url4.gov:/git/BaseProj
$ cd BaseProj
$ git clone url4.gov:/git/ExtraRepo1
$ git clone url4.gov:/git/ExtraRepo2

where, SYNC_BASE_DIR=~/sync_base_dir for example, which must already be
created.

Next, the remotes that define the integration pattern are created as follows:

$ cd $SYNC_BASE_DIR/BaseProj
$ git remote add integrate-from url4.gov:/git/BaseProj
$ cd ExtraRep1
$ git remote add integrate-from url2.gov:/git/ExtraRepo1
$ cd ..
$ cd ExtraRepo2
$ git remote add integrate-from url4.gov:/git/ExtraRepo2
$ cd ..

Above, the remote 'integrate-from' is used by the checkin-test.py wrapper
script (see below) to pull and merge in additional changes that will be tested
and pushed to the 'origin' repos on url4.gov.  In this case, the BaseProj and
ExtraRepo2 repos have the remote 'integrate-from' that points to the
same repos as 'origin' (and will therefore not result in any merging)
but the ExtraRepo1 remote 'integrate-from' will result in updates being
pulled from the main development repo on url2.gov, thereby facilitating
the update of ExtraRepo1 in the integrated project.


D) Integration Build Directory Setup
-----------------------------------

After the git repos are cloned and the remotes are set up, a builds base
directory is set up as:

$ cd $SYNC_BASE_DIR
$ mkdir BUILDS
$ mkdir BUILDS/CHECKIN

An ACI wrapper script for checkin-test.py is created to drive the clones.  It
is assumed that this script would be called only once a day and not
continuously in a loop (but that is possible as well but is not documented
here).

NOTE: Other build directory structures are possible, it all depends how one
writes the the checkin-test.py wrapper scripts but the above directory
structure is fairly standard in the usage of the checkin-test.py script.


E) Almost Continuous Integration Sync Driver Script
---------------------------------------------------

The sync driver script for this example should be called something like
sync_ExtraRepo1.sh, placed under version control, and would look something
like:

  #!/bin/bash
 
  EXTRA_ARGS=$@ 
  
  # Set up the environment (i.e. PATH; needed for cron jobs)
  ...

  SYNC_BASE_DIR=~/sync_base_dir
  CHECKIN_TEST_WRAPPER=$SYNC_BASE_DIR/BaseProj/sampleScripts/checkin-test-foo.sh

  cd $SYNC_BASE_DIR/BUILDS/CHECKIN

  $CHECKIN_TEST_WRAPPER \
    --extra-pull-from=integrate-from:master \
    --abort-gracefully-if-no-changes-to-push \
    --send-email-to=base-proj-integrators@url4.gov \
    --send-email-to-on-push=base-proj-integrators@url4.gov \
    --no-append-test-results --no-rebase \
    --do-all --push \
    -j16 \
    --wipe-clean \
    $EXTRA_ARGS

NOTE, in the above example sync_ExtraRepo1.sh script, the variable
CHECKIN_TEST_WRAPPER is set to a wrapper script

   BaseProj/sampleScripts/checkin-test-foo.sh

which would be set up to call the checkin-test.py script with configure
options for the specific machine.  The location and the nature of the wrapper
script will vary project to project.  In some simple cases,
CHECKIN_TEST_WRAPPER might just be set to be the raw machine-independent
checkin-test.py script for the project.

A description of each option passed into this invocation of the checkin-test
script is given below.

--extra-pull-from=integrate-from:master

  This option instructs the checkin-test.py script to pull and merge in
  commits that define the integration.  This remote and remote branch has to
  be the same in all git repos.  If it is not, then this option can't be used
  and instead the wrapper script should do the pulls up front manually before
  calling the checkin-test.py script.  The disadvantage of doing the pulls
  manually is that if they fail for some reason, they will not be seen by the
  checkin-test.py script and no notification email would go out.  However,
  integrating 'master' branches in different git repos is a very common use
  case when good Lean/Agile CI practices are used by all of the projects.

--abort-gracefully-if-no-changes-to-push

  This option makes the checkin-test.py script gracefully terminate without
  sending out any emails if after all the pulls, there are no local changes to
  push to the 'origin' repos.  This can happen, for example, if no commits
  were pushed to the main development git repo for ExtraRepo1 at
  url2.gov:/git/ExtraRepo1 since the last time this sync process was run.
  This avoids getting confusing and annoying emails like "PUSH FAILED".  The
  reason this option is not generally needed for local developer usage of the
  checkin-test.py script is that in general a developer will not run the
  checkin-test.py script with --push unless they have made local changes; it
  just does not make any sense at all to do that and if they do by accident,
  they should get an error email.  However, for an automated CI sync process,
  there is no easy way to know a priori if changes needs to be synced so the
  script supports this option to deal with that case gracefully.

--send-email-to=base-proj-integrators@url4.gov

  The results of the builds will be sent this email address.  If you only want
  an email sent when a push actually happens, you can set --send-email-to=''
  and rely on --send-email-to-on-push.

--send-email-to-on-push=base-proj-integrators@url4.gov

  A confirmation and summary email will be sent to this address if the push
  happens.  This can be a different email address than set by the
  --send-email-to option.  It is highly recommended that a mail list be used
  for this email address since this will be the only more permanent logging of
  the ACI process.

--no-append-test-results --no-rebase

  These options are needed to stop the checkin-test.py script for modifying
  the commits being tested and pushed from one public git repo to another.
  The option --no-append-test-results is needed to instruct the
  checkin-test.py script to *NOT* amend the last commit with the test results.
  The option --no-rebase is needed to avoid rebasing the new commits pulled
  from being rebased.  While the default behavior of the checkin-test.py
  script is to amend the last commit message and rebase the local commits
  (which is considered best practice when testing local commits), this is a
  very bad thing to do when a ACI sync server is only testing and moving
  commits between public repos.  Amending the last commit would change the
  SHA1 of the commit (just as a rebase would) and would fork the history and
  mess up a number of workflows that otherwise should work smoothly.  Since an
  email logging what was tested will go out if a push happens due to the
  --send-email-to-on-push argument, there is no value in appending the test
  results to the last commit pulled and merged (which will generally not be a
  merge commit but just a fast-forward).  There are cases, however, where
  appending the test results in an ACI process might be acceptable but they
  are not discussed here.

--do-all --push -j16

  These are standard options that always get used when invoking the
  checkin-test.py script and need no further explanation.

Note that since the option --enable-packages is not set in the above
invocation of the checkin-test.py script, therefore the checkin-test.py script
will decide on its own what packages to test just based on what packages have
changed files in the ExtraRepo1 git/TriBITS extra repository.  This is the
preferred way to go since any affected packages will automatically be enabled
as determined by the TriBITS package dependency structure and therefore this
driver script will require no modifications if the the dependency structure
changes over time.  However, there are cases for various reasons where the
exact list of packages to be tested (or not tested) should be specified using
the --enable-packages option (or the --disable-packages option, respectively).
However, these should not be needed with well structured portable TriBITS
repos and packages.

The sync script can be created and tested locally to ensure that it works
correctly first, before setting it as a cron job as described next.


F) Cron Job Setup
-----------------

Once the sync script sync_ExtraRepo1.sh has been locally tested, then it
should be committed to a version control git repo and then run automatically
as a cron job.  For example, the cron script shown below would fire off the
daily ACI process at 8pm every night:

# ----------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  -------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  ----------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  -------- month (1 - 12)
# |  |  |  |  ----- day of week (0 - 7) (Sunday=0 or 7)
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  *  command to be executed
 00 20  *  *  *  ~/sync_base_dir/sync_ExtraRepo1.sh &> ~/sync_base_dir/sync_ExtraRepo1.out

In the above crontab file (set with 'crontab -e' or 'crontab
my-crontab-file.txt'), the script:

  ~/sync_base_dir/sync_ExtraRepo1.sh
 
is assumed to be a soft symbolic link to some version controlled copy of
the ACI sync script.  For example, it might make sense for this script to be
version controlled in the BaseProj repo and therefore the symbolic link would
be created with something like:

$ cd ~/sync_base_dir/
$ ln -s BaseProj/sampleScripts/sync_ExtraRepo1.sh .

Such a setup would ensure that sync scripts would always be up-to-date due to the
git pulls part of the ACI process.


G) Addressing Failures and Summary
----------------------------------

After the above cron job starts running, it will send out emails to the email
addresses passed into the underlying checkin-test.py script.  If the emails
report an update, configure, build, or test failure, then someone will need to
log onto the machine where the ACI sync server is running and investigate what
went wrong, just like they would if the were running the checkin-test.py
script for testing locally modified changes before pushing.

In the above example, only a single git/TriBITS repo is integrated in this ACI
sync scripts.  For a complete system, other ACI sync scripts would be written
to sync the two other git/TriBITS repos in order to maintain some
independence.  Or, a single ACI sync script that tries to update all three
git/TriBITS repos at once would be written and used.  The pattern of
integrations chosen will depend many different factors.

In summary, the checkin-test.py script can be used to set up robust and
effective Almost Continuous Integration (ACI) sync servers that can be used to
integrate large collections of software in logical pieces at any logical
frequency.  Such an approach, together with the practice of Regulated Backward
Compatibility can allow very large collections of software to be kept
integrated in short time intervals using ACI.
