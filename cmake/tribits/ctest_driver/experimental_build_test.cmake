#
# CTest script that is used to do an experimental build/test right from a
# developer's own build directory.
#
# To run this script:
#
# 1) First configure your directory without enabling any packages (to set the
# platform-specific and site-specific options).  The CMakeCache.txt file that
# is created will then be modified by the script as packages are enabled and
# disabled.  NOTE: For the safest results, start with an empty build directory
# (except for your configure script of course).  This seems to be needed when
# switching back and forth between an 'Experimental' and 'Nightly' build for
# instance.
#
# 2) Run the script (overriding any appropriate options) as:
#
#    env ${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES="<PACKAGES>" \
#      ctest -S ${PROJECT_NAME}_TRIBITS_DIR/ctest/experimental_build_test.cmake -VV
#
# where PACAKGES is the semi-colon-separated list of packages being tested
# (e.g. ${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES="Teuchos;Epetra;NOX") and
# ${PROJECT_NAME}_TRIBITS_DIR points back to your home project directory.  You
# can take off the -VV argument if you don't want this to be too verbose.
#
# There are a number of other options that you can change as
# environment variables.  See the macros SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV(...)
# in the file TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake.  One option that you
# might want to overridde, for instance is CTEST_BUILD_NAME so that
# you can insert a special name into the dashboard.
#
# When this script finishes running, the last package listed in
# ${PROJECT_NAME}_PACAKGES will be enabled in the CMakeCache.txt file.
#
# NOTE: It is better to use the CMake-built make target 'dashboard' to run
# this script as it takes care of the details of manipulating the cache and
# restoring the package enables when it is done.
#

#
# General setup code:
#
# Do not modify any of this directly, use use environment variables instead!
#

#
# Include some CMake/CTest code files
