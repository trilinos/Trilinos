#
#   # Set some basic vars and include TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()
#   SET(TRIBITS_PROJECT_ROOT "${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/../../../..")

#   # Call the driver script to handle the rest
#   TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()
#
# This platform independent code is used in CTest -S scripts to drive the
# testing process for submitting to CDash for a TriBITS project.
#
# This function drives the following operations:
# 
# 1) **Clone or update all source version control (VC) repos** (Only if
#    `CTEST_DO_UPDATES`_ ``= TRUE``, otherwise existing source tree pointed to
#    by `CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`_ must already be in place).  Submit "Update"
#    data to CDash.
#
# 2) **Empty the build directory** pointed to by `CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`_
#    (only if `CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY`_ ``= TRUE``).
#
# 3) **Generate the file <Project>PackageDependencies.xml** which is needed to
#    determine which packages need to be tested based on changes (only if
#    `CTEST_GENERATE_OUTER_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE`_ ``= TRUE``).
#
# 4) **Generate the file CDashSubprojectDependencies.xml** (only if
#    `CTEST_SUBMIT_CDASH_SUBPROJECTS_DEPS_FILE`_ ``= TRUE``).  Submit file to
#    CDash to inform of subproject structure and email addresses.
#
# 5) **Determine the set of packages to be tested**.  If
#    `CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY`_ ``= TRUE``, then this is
#    determined by the files that have changed since the last build and
#    therefore what TriBITS packages need to be tested (can only be used if
#    and the underlying source tree repos must are git repos).  Otherwise, one
#    can directly set `${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`_ and other variables (see
#    `Determining What Packages Get Tested (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER())`_).
#
# 6) **Configure the selected packages to be tested** in the build directory
#    pointed to by `CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`_.  Submit "Configure" and "Notes"
#    data to CDash.
#
# 7) **Build configured packages and the enabled package tests**.  Submit
#    "Build" data to CDash.
#
# 8) **Run enabled tests for the configured packages** (only if
#    `CTEST_DO_TEST`_ = ``TRUE``).  (Also, this will generate coverage data if
#    `CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING`_ ``= TRUE``).  Submit "Test" data to CDash.
#
# 9) **Collect coverage results from tests already run** (only if
#    `CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING`_ ``= TRUE``).  Submit "Coverage" data to
#    CDash.
#
# 10) **Run dynamic analysis testing on defined test suite** (e.g. run
#     ``valgrind`` with each of the test commands (only if
#     `CTEST_DO_MEMORY_TESTING`_ ``= TRUE``).  Submit "MemCheck" data to CDash.
#
# After each of these steps, results are submitted to CDash if
# `CTEST_DO_SUBMIT`_ ``= TRUE`` and otherwise no data is submitted to any
# CDash site (which is good for local debugging of CTest -S driver scripts).
# For the package-by-package mode these steps 6-10 for configure, build, and
# running tests shown above are actually done in a loop package-by-package
# with submits for each package to be tested.  For the all-at-once mode, these
# steps are done all at once for the selected packages to be tested and
# results are submitted to CDash all-at-once for all packages together (see
# `All-at-once versus package-by-package mode (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER())`_).
#
# For context for how this function is used, see:
#
# * `TriBITS CTest/CDash Driver`_
# * `How to submit testing results to a CDash site`_
#
# Also note that this function executes `Reduced Package Dependency
# Processing`_ so all of the files described in that process are read in while
# this function runs.  This processing is needed to determine the TriBITS
# package dependency graph and to determine the set of packages to be enabled
# or disabled when determining the set of packages to be tested.

# **List of all variables (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# .. _Setting variables (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):
#
# **Setting variables (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# Variables can be set to control the behavior of this function before the
# function is called.  Some variables must be set in the CTest -S driver
# script before calling this function ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()``.  Many
# variables have a default value that will work in most cases.
#
# In general, these variables fall into one of three different categories:
#
# * **Variables that must be set in the outer CTest -S driver script before
#   the TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake module is even included:** Many of these
#   can also be overridden from an env var of the same name.  There are very
#   few of these variables and they are specifically called out below.
#
# * **Variables with no default value that must set in the outer CTest -S
#   driver script after the TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake module is included
#   but before TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER() is called:** There are very few of these
#   variables and in some cases, they may be optional.  These types of
#   variables will be called out below.
#
# * **Variables that can be are set before TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER() is called
#   but have default values provided in the TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER() function
#   and may look for env var overrides:** This comprises the majority of the
#   variables used in ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()``.  The variables that have
#   default values but allow for an override as an env var use the function
#   `SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV()`_.  In the case of variables that are given a
#   default value with ``SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV()``, their value is always
#   overridden with what is in the env var of the same name.  In this case,
#   the overriding value that is read in from the env is printed out.  In
#   either case, the value used for these variables is printed out.
#
# Which variables are which are described below for each variable.
#
# .. _Source and Binary Directory Locations (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):
#
# **Source and Binary Directory Locations (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# To understand how to set the source and binary directories, one must
# understand that CTest -S scripts using this function get run in one of two
# different modes:
#
# **Mode 1**: Run where there are **already existing source and binary
# directories** (i.e.  is set empty before call).  In this case,
# `CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`_ and `CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`_ must be set by the
# user before calling this function (and `CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`_ is empty).
# This mode is typically used to test a local build or an existing cloned and
# setup set source tree and post to CDash (see the custom ``dashboard`` target
# in `Dashboard Submissions`_).
#
# **Mode 2**: A **new binary directory is created and optionally new sources
# are cloned or updated** under a driver directory
# (i.e. ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`` is set before call and that directory will be
# created if it does not already exist).  In this case, there are typically
# two (partial) project source tree's, a) the "driver" skeleton source tree
# (typically with an embedded tribits/ directory) that bootstraps the testing
# process that contains the CTest -S driver script, and b) the full "source"
# tree that is (optionally) cloned and/or updated and is directly configured,
# build, and tested.  This mode can also handle the case where the source tree
# is already set up in the location pointed to by `CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`_
# and `CTEST_DO_SUBMIT`_ is set to ``FALSE`` so this mode can get away with a
# single source tree and can handle a variety of use cases that may
# pre-manipulate the source tree before ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()`` is run.
#
# There are a few different directory locations that are significant for this
# script used in one or both of the modes described above:
#
#   .. _TRIBITS_PROJECT_ROOT:
#
#   ``TRIBITS_PROJECT_ROOT``.
#
#     The root directory to an existing source tree where the project's
#     `<projectDir>/ProjectName.cmake`_ (defining the ``PROJECT_NAME``
#     variable) and `<projectDir>/Version.cmake`_ files can be found.  This
#     can be SET() in the CTest -S script or override as an env var.  The
#     default and env override is set for this during the INCLUDE() of the
#     module ``TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake``.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TRIBITS_DIR``
#
#     The base directory for the TriBITS system's various CMake modules,
#     python scripts, and other files.  By default this is assumed to be
#     ``${TRIBITS_PROJECT_ROOT}/cmake/tribits``.  This can be SET() in the
#     CTest -S script or overridden as an env var.  The default and env
#     override is set for this during the INCLUDE() of
#     ``TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT:
#
#   ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT``
#
#     If set, this is the base directory where this script runs that clones
#     the sources for the project.  If this directory does not exist, it will
#     be created.  If provided as the special value ``PWD``, then the present
#     working directory is used.  If empty, then this var has no effect.  This
#     can be SET() in CTest -S script before the call to
#     ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()`` or override as an env var.
#
#   .. _CTEST_SOURCE_NAME:
#
#   ``CTEST_SOURCE_NAME``
#
#     The name of the source directory.  This can be SET() in the CTest -S
#     script before the call to ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()`` or overridden as an
#     env var. By default, this is set to ``${PROJECT_NAME}``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY:
#
#   ``CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that determines the location of the sources that
#     are used to define packages, dependencies and configure, build, and test
#     the software.  This is a variable that CTest directly reads and must
#     therefore be set. This is used to set `PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR`_ which is
#     used by the TriBITS system.  If ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`` is set, then
#     this is hard-coded internally to
#     ``${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}/${CTEST_SOURCE_NAME}`` and will therefore
#     override any value that might be set in the CTest -S driver script.
#     However, if ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`` is empty when
#     ``TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake`` is INCLUDED(), then by default it set
#     to ``${TRIBITS_PROJECT_ROOT}``.  This can only be SET() in the CTest -S
#     driver script and is not overridden as an env var.  The only way to
#     override in the ENV is to indirectly set through
#     ``${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY:
#
#   ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that determines the location of the binary tree
#     where output from CMake/CTest is put.  This is used to set to
#     `PROJECT_BINARY_DIR`_ which is used by the TriBITS system and this
#     variable is directly ready by CTest itself.  If ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT``
#     is set, then this is hard-coded internally to
#     ``${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}/BUILD`` (overwriting any existing value of
#     ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY``).  If ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`` is empty
#     when ``TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake`` is INCLUDED(), then by default it
#     set to ``$ENV{PWD}/BUILD``.  ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`` can not be

#
# **Determining What Packages Get Tested (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# Before any testing is done, the set of packages to be tested is determined.
# This determination uses the basic `TriBITS Dependency Handling Behaviors`_
# and logic.  By default, the set of packages to be tested and otherwise
# explicitly processed is determined by the vars (which can also be set as env
# vars):
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES``
#
#     A semi-colon ';' or comma ',' separated list of packages that determines
#     the specific set of packages to test.  If left at the default value of
#     empty "", then `${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES`_ is set to ``ON``
#     and that enables packages as described in `<Project>_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES
#     enables all PT (cond. ST) SE packages`_.  This variable can use ',' to
#     separate package names instead of ';'.  The default value is empty "".
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES``
#
#     If ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`` is empty (and therefore
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES=ON`` is set), then additional
#     packages not enabled in that logic can be listed
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES`` and they will be tested as well.
#     For example, if this wold be used when there are some additional ST or
#     EX packages that should be tested in a PT build
#     (e.g. ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_SECONDARY_TESTED_CODE=FALSE``.  The
#     default value is empty "".
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES``
#
#     If set to ``TRUE``, then all of the downstream packages from those
#     specified in ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`` will be enabled (see
#     `<Project>_ENABLE_ALL_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES enables downstream
#     packages/tests`_).  The default value is ``FALSE`` unless
#     ``CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY=TRUE`` is set in which case the
#     default value is ``TRUE``.  This also gets passed to the inner CMake
#     configure.
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_SECONDARY_TESTED_CODE:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_SECONDARY_TESTED_CODE``
#
#     If set to ``TRUE``, then ST packages will get enabled in automated logic
#     in the outer determination of what packages to get tested.  This value
#     also gets passed to the inner CMake configure.  The default value is
#     ``OFF``.
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_EXCLUDE_PACKAGES:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXCLUDE_PACKAGES``
#
#     A list of package **NOT** to enable when determining the set of packages
#     to be tested.  NOTE: Listing packages here will *not* disable the
#     package in the inner CMake configure.  To do that, you will have to
#     disable them in the variable EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS (set in your driver
#     script). This list can be specified with semi-colons ';' or with comas
#     ','.  The default value is empty "".
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_DISABLE_ENABLED_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES``
#
#     If set to ``ON`` (or ``TRUE``), then if there are conflicts between
#     explicit enables and disables then explicit disables will override the
#     explicit enables (see `Disables trump enables where there is a
#     conflict`_).  The default is ``ON`` and likely should not be changed.
#     The default value is ``ON``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES:
#
#   ``CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES``
#
#     If set to ``TRUE``, then all of the upstream packages for those selected
#     to be explicitly tested will be processed with results posted to CDash.
#     The default is ``TRUE`` unless
#     ``CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY==TRUE``.  Most builds that specify
#     a specific set of packages in ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`` should likely
#     set this to ``FALSE``.
#
# NOTE: Any and all of the above vars can be set as env vars and they will
# override the value set inside the CTest -S script with ``SET()``` (or
# `SET_DEFAULT()`_) statements.  Also, for any of the vars that take a list,
# the CMake standard semi-colon char ';' can be used to separate list items or
# comas ',' can be used so that they can be used when setting env vars.  (The
# comas ',' are then replaced with semi-colons ';' internally before
# interpreted as an list by CMake.)
#
# The other mode for selecting the set of packages to be tested is to only
# test the packages that have changes since the last time this build was run
# and testing packages that previously failed.  That mode is turned on by the
# var:
#
#   .. _CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY:
#
#   ``CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then only packages that have changes pulled from the git
#     repos since the last time the build ran will be tested (in addition to
#     packages that failed in the last build).  If ``FALSE``, the set of
#     packages to be tested is determined by `${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`_ and
#     other variables as described above.
#
# .. _Setting variables in the inner CMake configure (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):
#
# **Setting variables in the inner CMake configure:**
#
# It is important to understand that none of the CMake vars that get set in
# the other CTest -S program that calls ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()``
# automatically get passed into the inner configure of the TriBITS CMake
# project using the ``CTEST_CONFIGURE()`` command by CMake.  From the
# perspective of raw CTest and CMake, these are completely separate programs.
# However, the ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()`` function will forward subset of
# variables documented below into the inner CMake configure.  The following
# variables that are set in the outer CTest -S program will be passed into the
# inner CMake configure by default (but their values they can be overridden by
# options listed in ``EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS`` or
# ``EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS``):
#
#   ``-D${PROJECT_NAME}_IGNORE_MISSING_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES=ON``
#
#     Missing extra repos are always ignored in the inner CMake configure.
#     This is because any problems reading an extra repo will be caught in the
#     outer CTest -S drivers script.
#
#   ``-D${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON``
#
#     Because of the behavior of the package-by-package mode, currently, this
#     is hard-coded to ``ON``.  (This set may be removed in the future for the
#     all-at-once mode.)
#
#   ``-D${PROJECT_NAME}_ALLOW_NO_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON``
#
#     This is currently set for the package-by-package mode since some
#     packages may get disabled because required upstream dependent packages
#     may be disabled.  (This set may be removed in the future for the
#     all-at-once mode.)
#
# The following variables set in the CTest -S driver script will be passed
# down into the inner CMake configure through the ``OPTIONS`` variable to the
# ``CTEST_CONFIGURE()`` command:
#
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TRIBITS_DIR``: Direct pass-through
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS_FLAGS``: Direct pass-through
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_DISABLE_ENABLED_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES``: Direct pass-through
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE``: Set to empty if
#   ``CTEST_GENERATE_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE==FALSE``
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_SECONDARY_TESTED_CODE``: Direct pass-through
# * ``MPI_EXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS``: Direct pass-through
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING``: Set to ``ON`` if
#   ``CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING==TRUE``
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE``: Set to empty if
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE=NONE``. Otherwise, passed through.
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE``: Direct pass-through
#
# Arbitrary options can be set to be passed into the inner CMake configure
# after the above options are passed by setting the following variables in the
# outer CTest -S driver script file before calling ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()``
# (but are **NOT** read in as env vars):
#
#   .. _EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS:
#
#   ``EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS``
#
#     Additional list of system-specific options to be passed to the inner
#     CMake configure.  This must be set in the CTest -S driver script with a
#     ``SET()`` statement (i.e. env var is not read).  These options get added
#     after all of the above pass-through options so they can override any of
#     those options.  **WARNING:** Do not include any semicolons ';' in these
#     arguments (see below WARNING).
#
#   .. _EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS:
#
#   ``EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS``
#
#     Additional list of extra cmake configure options to be passed to the
#     inner CMake configure.  This must be set in the CTest -S driver script
#     with a ``SET()`` statement (i.e. env var is not read).  These options
#     get added after all of the above pass-through options and the options
#     listed in ``EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS`` so they can override any of
#     those options.  **WARNING:** Do not include any semicolons ';' in these
#     arguments (see below WARNING).
#
# These configure options are passed into the ``CTEST_CONFIGURE()`` command in
# the order::
#
#  <initial options> ${EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS}} ${EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS}
#
# **WARNING:** The options listed in ``EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS`` and
# ``EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS`` should not contain any semi-colons ';' or they
# will be interpreted as array bounds and mess up the arguments when passed to
# the inner CMake configure.  To avoid problems with spaces and semicolons, it
# is usually a good idea to put these cache vars into ``*.cmake`` file
# fragments and the pass them through using the variable
# `<Project>_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_FILE`_ as::
#
#   -D<Project>_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_FILE=<optionsfile1>.cmake,<optionsfile2>.cmake,...
#
# NOTE: The full list of options passed into the inner CMake is printed out
# before calling ``CTEST_CONFIGURE()`` so any issues setting options and the
# ordering of options can be seen in that printout.
#
# .. _Determining what testing-related actions are performed (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):
#
# **Determining what testing-related actions are performed (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# When run, ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()`` always performs a configure and build
# but other actions are optional.  By default, a version control update (or
# clone) is performed as well as running tests and submitting results to
# CDash.  But the version control update, the running tests and submitting
# results to CDash can be disabled.  Also, coverage testing and memory testing
# are not performed by default but they can be turned on with results
# submitted to CDash.  These actions are controlled by the following variables
# (which can be set in the CTest -S script before calling
# ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()`` and can be overridden by env vars of the same
# name):
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_UPDATES``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then the source repos will be updated as specified in
#     `Repository Updates (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER())`_.
#
#   .. _CTEST_UPDATE_ARGS:
#
#   ``CTEST_UPDATE_ARGS``
#
#     Any extra arguments to use with ``git clone`` to clone the base git repo.
#     The default value is empty "".  This is only used for the base git repo
#     (not the extra repos).
#
#   .. _CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY:
#
#   ``CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then if the binary directory ``${CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY}``
#     already exists, then it will be clean out using the CTest command
#     ``CTEST_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY()``.  However, this can set to ``FALSE``
#     in which case a rebuild (using existing object files, libraries, etc.)
#     will be performed which is useful when using an incremental CI server.
#     The default is ``TRUE`` (which is the most robust option).
#
#   .. _CTEST_WIPE_CACHE:
#
#   ``CTEST_WIPE_CACHE``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then ``${CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY}/CMakeCache.txt`` and
#     ``${CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY}/CMakeFiles/`` will be deleted before
#     performing a configure.  (This value is set to ``FALSE`` by the `make
#     dashboard`_ target that does an experimental build, test, and submit to
#     CDash.)  The default value is ``TRUE`` (which is the most robust option
#     in general).
#
#   .. _CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS:
#
#   ``CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS``
#
#     Build-in CTest variable that gives the flags passed to the build command
#     called inside of the built-in CTest command ``CTEST_BUILD()``.  The
#     default is ``-j2`` when ``CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR`` is set to "Unix
#     Makefiles".  Otherwise, the default is empty "".  Useful options to set
#     are ``-j<N>`` (to build on parallel) and ``-k`` (to keep going when
#     there are build errors so we can see all of the build errors).
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_TEST:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_TEST``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then ``CTEST_TEST()`` will be called and test results will
#     be submitted to CDash.  This should be set to ``FALSE`` when one wanted
#     to only test the configure and build of a project but not run any tests
#     (e.g. when cross compiling or if the tests are too expensive to run).
#     The default value is ``TRUE``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL:
#
#   ``CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL``
#
#     The parallel level passed in the ``PARALLEL_LEVEL`` argument to
#     ``CTEST_TEST()`` AND ``CTEST_MEMCHECK()``.  The default value is ``1``
#     (one).
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then ``CTEST_COVERAGE()`` is called to collect coverage and
#     submit results generated from the previous ``CTEST_TEST()`` command.
#     Setting this to ``TRUE`` also results in
#     ``-D${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING=ON`` getting passed down to
#     the inner CMake configure of the project (i.e. so that the executables
#     are instrumented to generate coverage data when run by the tests in the
#     ``CTEST_TEST()`` command).
#
#   .. _CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND:
#
#   ``CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that determines the command that is run by
#     ``CTEST_COVERAGE()`` to collect coverage results.  That default value is
#     ``gcov``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_MEMORY_TESTING:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_MEMORY_TESTING``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then ``CTEST_MEMCHECK()`` is called to run the test suite
#     with the memory checking tool and results submitted to CDash.
#
#   .. _CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND:
#
#   ``CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that determines the command that is used to run
#     the command for each test run by the ``CTEST_MEMCHECK()`` command.  If
#     ``valgrind`` is found on the local system, then that is used by default.
#     Otherwise, the default is empty "".
#
#   .. _CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS:
#
#   ``CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that determines what options are passed to the
#     memory checking command before the actual test command.  The default
#     value is empty "".
#
#   .. _CTEST_GENERATE_OUTER_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE:
#
#   ``CTEST_GENERATE_OUTER_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then ``<Project>PackageDependencies.xml`` file will be
#     generated in the outer CTest -S program.  This file is used to help
#     determine what packages have changed and need to be tested when in CI
#     mode (e.g. when ``CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY=TRUE`` is set).
#     It is also needed to generate the ``CDashSubprojectDependencies.xml``
#     file that gets submitted to CDash to inform it of the list of
#     subprojects and subproject dependencies (i.e. TriBITS packages).  The
#     default value is ``TRUE``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_SUBMIT_CDASH_SUBPROJECTS_DEPS_FILE:
#
#   ``CTEST_SUBMIT_CDASH_SUBPROJECTS_DEPS_FILE``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then CDash subprojects XML file is generated and submitted
#     to CDash.  This file tells CDash about the subproject (i.e. TriBITS
#     package) structure.  The default value is ``TRUE``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_SUBMIT:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_SUBMIT``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then all of the results generated locally are submitted to
#     CDash using ``CTEST_SUBMIT()``.  One can set this to ``FALSE`` when
#     locally debugging a CTest -S driver script to avoid spamming CDash.  The
#     default value is ``TRUE``.  (NOTE: This may submit to more than one
#     CDash site as noted in `Specifying where the results go to CDash
#     (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER())`_).
#
# .. _Determining how the results are displayed on CDash (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):
#
# **Determining how the results are displayed on CDash (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# These options all primarily determine how VC update, configure, build, test,
# and other results and submitted and displayed on CDash (but not what CDash
# site(s) or project(s) they are submitted to).  These options can all be set
# in the CTest -S script using ``SET()`` statements before
# ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()`` is called and can be overridden in the env.
#
#   .. _CTEST_TEST_TYPE:
#
#   ``CTEST_TEST_TYPE``
#
#     Determines the type of build.  This value is passed in as the first
#     argument to the built-in CTest function ``CTEST_START()``.  Valid values
#     include ``Nightly``, ``Continuous``, and ``Experimental``.  This also
#     defines the default value for `${PROJECT_NAME}_TESTING_TRACK`_ as well
#     as defines the default value for
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE``.  The default value
#     is ``Experimental``.
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_TESTING_TRACK:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TESTING_TRACK``
#
#     Specifies the testing track on CDash for which results are displayed
#     under (i.e. the "Group" filter field on CDash).  This is the value used
#     for the ``TRACK`` argument of the built-in CTest function
#     ``CTEST_START()``.  It is given the default value of
#     ``${CTEST_TEST_TYPE}``.  However, if ``CTEST_TEST_TYPE==Experimental``
#     (or ``EXPERIMENTAL``), then ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TESTING_TRACK`` is forced
#     to ``Experimental``, even if it was set to a different value.
#
#   .. _CTEST_SITE:
#
#   ``CTEST_SITE``
#
#     This is a built-in CTest variable that determines what is displayed for
#     the ``site`` field for the build on CDash.  This specified by default by
#     calling the built-in CMake/CTest function ``SITE_NAME()``.
#
#   .. _COMPILER_VERSION:
#
#   ``COMPILER_VERSION``
#
#     Gives the name of the compiler that is used to compose a default
#     `CTEST_BUILD_NAME`_.  If ``CTEST_BUILD_NAME`` is explicitly set, then
#     this value is ignored.
#
#   .. _CTEST_BUILD_NAME:
#
#   ``CTEST_BUILD_NAME``
#
#     This is a built-in CTest variable that determines the name of the build
#     on CDash.  Builds that have the same ``CTEST_SITE``,
#     ``CTEST_BUILD_NAME`` and ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TRACK`` are considered to be
#     related builds and CDash will relate them as "previous" and "next"
#     builds (good for showing number of added or removed tests, new test
#     failures, new passing tests, etc.).  If not specified, it is given the
#     default value ``${HOST_TYPE}-${COMPILER_VERSION}-${BUILD_DIR_NAME}``.
#     Here, ``HOST_TYPE`` is determined automatically from the ``uname``
#     system command using ``FIND_PROGRAM(uname)``.  The value of
#     ``BUILD_DIR_NAME`` is expected to be set in each specific CTest -S
#     driver script.
#
# .. _Specifying where the results go to CDash (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):
#
# **Specifying where the results go to CDash (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# By default, the target CDash server and CDash project are specified by the
# variables set in the file `<projectDir>/CTestConfig.cmake`_; specifically,
# ``CTEST_DROP_SITE``, ``CTEST_PROJECT_NAME``, and ``CTEST_DROP_LOCATION``.
# If these are set using `SET_DEFAULT_AND_FROM_ENV()`_, as shown in the
# example ``TribitsExampleProject/CTestConfig.cmake`` file, then they can be
# overridden with ``SET()`` statements in the CTest -S script or as env vars;
# simple enough.
#
# In addition, results can be sent to a second CDash site using the variables:
#
#   ``TRIBITS_2ND_CTEST_DROP_SITE``
#
#     CDash drop site for second upload of results.  If empty, then
#     ``CTEST_DROP_SITE`` is used.
#
#   ``TRIBITS_2ND_CTEST_DROP_LOCATION``
#
#     Location for the second drop site.  If empty, then
#     ``CTEST_DROP_LOCATION`` is used.
#
# At lease one of these vars must be set to non empty or a second submit will
# not be performed.  For more details, see `TRIBITS_2ND_CTEST_DROP_SITE`_ and
# `TRIBITS_2ND_CTEST_DROP_LOCATION`_.
#
# .. _Determining what TriBITS repositories are included (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):
#
# **Determining what TriBITS repositories are included (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# This script is set up to process extra VC and TriBITS repos that contribute
# additional TriBITS packages to the base TriBITS project.  This set of extra
# repos is determined using the following vars (which can be set in the CTest
# -S script or overridden with env vars of the same name):
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE``
#
#     Points to a file that lists the extra VC and TriBITS repos. If not
#     explicitly set, then by default it will read from the file
#     `<projectDir>/cmake/ExtraRepositoriesList.cmake`_ unless
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_SKIP_EXTRAREPOS_FILE=TRUE`` is set in the
#     ``ProjectName.cmake`` file in which case no extra repos file is read in.
#     See `<Project>_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`_.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE``
#
#     The category of extra repos to process from the file
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`` (see
#     `<Project>_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE`_).
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PRE_REPOSITORIES``
#
#     Subset of "pre" extra repos specified in the file
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`` to process (see
#     `<Project>_PRE_REPOSITORIES`_).
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES``
#
#     Subset of "post" extra repos specified in the file
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`` to process (see
#     `<Project>_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES`_).
#
# The behavior for selecting extra repos using these variables is determined
# as described in:
#
# * `Enabling extra repositories through a file`_
#
# .. _All-at-once versus package-by-package mode (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):
#
# **All-at-once versus package-by-package mode (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# This function supports driving the configure, build, testing, and submitting
# to CDash of the packages in the TriBITS project either all-at-once or
# package-by-package, based on the vars (which can be set in the CTest -S
# script and overridden by env vars):
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_USE_NEW_AAO_FEATURES:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_USE_NEW_AAO_FEATURES``
#
#     If set to ``TRUE``, then new features of CMake, CTest, and CDash will be
#     used to allow for efficient all-at-once configure, build, test, and
#     submit to CDash while breaking down results package-by-package on CDash.
#     But only a version of CDash released after 9/2017 will have the changes
#     to take advantage of this.  The default value is ``FALSE``.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_DO_ALL_AT_ONCE``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then single calls to ``CTEST_CONFIGURE()``,
#     ``CTEST_BUILD()`` and ``CTEST_TEST()`` are made for all of the packages
#     to be tested all at once with ``CTEST_SUBMIT()`` called after each of
#     these.  If ``FALSE`` then ``CTEST_CONFIGURE()``, ``CTEST_BUILD()`` and
#     ``CTEST_TEST()`` and ``CTEST_SUBMIT()`` are called in a loop, once for
#     each package to be explicitly tested.  The default value is set to
#     ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_USE_NEW_AAO_FEATURES}``.
#
# Both the all-at-once mode and the package-by-package mode should produce
# equivalent builds of the project and submits to CDash (for correctly
# constructed TriBITS projects and packages).  But the package-by-package mode
# will disable packages with failing library builds when processing downstream
# packages, and therefore reduce the propagation of failures to downstream
# packages and therefore is more robust.  But the package-by-package mode is
# more expensive in several respects for many projects.
#
# For versions of CMake 3.10.0 and above and newer versions of CDash, the
# CDash server for the all-at-once mode will break down build and test results
# on a package-by-package basis on CDash.
# together.
#
# **NOTE:** It has been confirmed that older versions of CDash can accept and
# display results from newer CMake/CTest versions when
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_USE_NEW_AAO_FEATURES`` set to ``TRUE``.  It is just
# that for older versions of CDash that it will not break down results on a
# package-by-package basis on CDash and all of the build warnings and errors
# and tests will be all globed together on CDash.
#
# .. _Repository Updates (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):
#
# **Repository Updates (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# Like the rest of TriBITS, ``ctest -S`` scripts written using this function
# supports a collection of extra repositories in addition to the base git
# repository.  The basic clone and update of the extra repositories requires
# all repos to use the git version control system.
#
# Whether the repos are updated (or left as is) is determined by the var:
#
#  .. _CTEST_DO_UPDATES:
#
#  ``CTEST_DO_UPDATES``
#
#    If set to ``TRUE``, then each of the git repos will be cloned if they do
#    not already exist at `CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY` and if already present will
#    be updated as described below (and will wipe out any local changes).  If
#    set to ``FALSE``, then the git repos will be left alone and must
#    therefore already be cloned and updated at the desired state.  For
#    example, this should be set to ``FALSE`` when running against a local
#    development repo (e.g. the `make dashboard`_ target sets this to
#    ``FALSE`` automatically) or when other logic is used to setup the source
#    directories. **WARNING:** If you are running against a local repo with
#    local changes and you don't set to ``FALSE``, then your local uncommitted
#    changes will be wiped out and the local branch will be hard reset to the
#    remote tracking branch!  The default value is ``TRUE``.
#
# **WARNING:** If you don't want local changes in your git repos to get blown
# away, then set ``CTEST_DO_UPDATES`` to ``FALSE``!
#
# CTest itself is used for handling the cloning and the pull of the base
# repository by calling ``CTEST_UPDATE()``.  The repo that is cloned is
# determined by:
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_LOCATION:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_LOCATION``
#
#     The location of the base git repo to clone inside of ``CTEST_UPDATE()``.
#     The default is
#     ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_LOCATION_NIGHTLY_DEFAULT}`` when
#     ``CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Nightly`` and otherwise the default is
#     ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_LOCATION_DEFAULT}``.
#
# The cloning of the extra git repositories are completely handled by the
# CMake/CTest code in this ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()`` function as described
# below.
#
# After the base repository is cloned for the first time (by calling
# ``CTEST_UPDATE()``), the extra repositories are cloned using the following
# command::
#
#   git clone <extrarepo_url>
#
# where ``<extrarepo_url>`` is given in the
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`` file.
# 
# Therefore, by default, whatever the default branch is set to on clone in the
# base repos, that is the branch that will be used.  Also, future repository
# updates will be done on those branches according to their set up remote
# tracking branch.
#
# However the branches of the code tested can be explicitly set using the
# vars:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH``
#
#     The branch of the base repo to explicitly checkout after clone (and on
#     each update).  The default is
#     ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_BRANCH}}``.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_BRANCH``
#
#     Defines the default for ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH``.  This must be set in
#     the CTest -S script (e.g. in the ``<projectDir>/CTestConfig.cmake``
#     file).  The default if not otherwise specified is empty "".
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_BRANCH``
#
#     The branch that each extra VC repo that is checked out.  The default
#     value is set to ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH}``.  (NOTE: Checking out a
#     separate branch on the extra repos from the base repo was needed for
#     backward compatibility for the Trilinos project but this is not
#     recommended usage and it violates the "single branch" approach for using
#     `gitdist`_.)
#
# If ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` is set to non-empty, then that branch will be
# checked out in all of the repositories.  For the base repository, after the
# clone or update is performed in the call to ``CTEST_UPDATE()``, then that
# branch is checked out using the command::
#
#   $ git checkout -B ${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH} \
#       --track origin/${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH}`
#
# That command is robust and will pass even if the current branch is already a
# tracking branch for ``origin/${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH}``.  **WARNING:** This
# version of the ``git checkout -B``` command is not supported in older
# versions of git.
#
# If ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPO_BRANCH`` is empty, then each extra repository
# is updated (even after the initial clone) using the commands::
#
#   $ git clean -fdx         # Remove untracked ignored files
#   $ git reset --hard HEAD  # Removed untracked and modified tracked files
#   $ git fetch origin       # Get updated commits
#   $ git reset --hard @{u}  # Deal with forced push
#
# The command ``git clone -fdx`` removes any untracked ignored files that may
# have been created since the last update (either by the build process or by
# someone messing around in that local git repository).  The command ``git
# reset --hard HEAD`` removes any untracked non-ignored files, any modified
# tracked files, and sets ``ORIG_HEAD`` to the current ``HEAD``.  This sets
# ``ORIG_HEAD`` after the initial clone (which is needed since ``ORIG_HEAD``
# is not set after the initial ``git clone``).  This allows using the range
# ``ORIG_HEAD..HEAD`` with git diff and log commands even after the initial
# clone.  The ``git fetch`` command followed by the ``git reset --hard @{u}``
# command are used to update the local repo to match the remote tracking
# branch instead of ``git pull` or ``git fetch ; git merge @{u}``.  This is
# done to deal with a possible forced push of the remote tracking branch.
# Using ``git fetch ; git reset --hard @{u}`` ensures that the local branch is
# exactly the same the remote tracking branch no matter what.
#
# If ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPO_BRANCH`` is non-empty, then each extra
# repository is updated (even after the initial clone) using the commands::
#
#   $ git clean -fdx         # Remove untracked ignored files
#   $ git reset --hard HEAD  # Clean files and set ORIG_HEAD to HEAD
#   $ git fetch origin       # Get updated commits
#   $ git checkout -B ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPO_BRANCH} \
#       --track origin/${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPO_BRANCH}  # Put on tracking branch
#
# These are the same commands as for the case where
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPO_BRANCH`` is empty except for the last command
# which does a checkout of the tracking branch
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPO_BRANCH``.  In this case, the ``git reset --hard
# HEAD`` serves an additional purpose.  It sets ``ORIG_HEAD`` to the current
# ``HEAD`` before the update of the branch.  This is important because the
# command ``git checkout -B ...`` does not move ``ORIG_HEAD`` so this reset is
# needed so that the git range ``ORIG_HEAD..HEAD`` gives the changes since the
# last update.  So for an update where no new commits are pulled,
# ``ORIG_HEAD..HEAD`` will return no commits.
#
# Note that the repository updating approach described above using non-empty
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` is more robust, because it can recover from a
# state where someone may have put a repo on a detached head or checked out a
# different branch.  One of these repos might get into this state when a
# person is messing around in the Nightly build and source directories to try
# to figure out what happened and forgot to put the repos back on the correct
# tracking branch.  Therefore, it is recommended to always set
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` to a non-null value like ``master`` or
# ``develop`` for the git repos.
#
# .. _Other CTest Driver options (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):
#
# **Other CTest Driver options (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# Other miscellaneous vars that can be set in the CTest -S script or as env
# vars are given below.
#
#   ``CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR``
#
#     The CMake generator.  If an existing ``CMakeCache.txt`` file exists,
#     then the generator will be read out of that file.  Otherwise, the
#     default generator is selected to be ``Unix Makefiles``.  NOTE: Currently
#     this value is **NOT** passed down into the inner CMake configure step!
#     Currently, its only purpose is to select the default value for
#     `CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS`_.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE``
#
#     Puts TriBITS configure into development mode (vs. release mode) in the
#     outer CTest -S script.  The default is provided by
#     ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE_DEFAULT}}`` (which is
#     typically set in the `<projectDir>/Version.cmake`_ file).  See
#     `<Project>_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE`_.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_VERBOSE_CONFIGURE``
#
#     Make TriBITS run in verbose mode.  (Useful for debugging hard problems.)
#     See `<Project>_VERBOSE_CONFIGURE`_.
#
#   ``CTEST_CONFIGURATION_UNIT_TESTING``
#
#     If set to ``TRUE``, then ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()`` is put in unit
#     testing mode and does not actually drive configure, build, test, and
#     submit.  This is used to drive automated testing of the code in
#     ``TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()``.
#
# .. _Return value (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):
#
# **Return value (TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()):**
#
# Currently, the ctest -S script will return 0 if all of the requested
# operations completed without failure.  That is, the update, configure,
# build, tests, coverage, dynamic analysis and submits must pass with no CMake
# errors in order for a 0 return code to be returned.  Therefore, the return
# code from the ctest -S script can be used to drive other automated processes
# that require all passing builds and tests.
#
# ToDo: Add another mode that will return 0 if no errors are reported in the
# ctest -S driver script but ignore configure, build, and test failures that
# are submitted to a CDash site (and therefore will be reported there).
