# @FUNCTION: TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()
#
# Platform-independent CTest/CDash driver
#
# Usage::
#
#   TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER()
#
# This driver code is platform independent.  CTest -S scripts use this
# function to drive the testing process for a TriBITS projects by doing a
# version control (VC) source update on all of the VC repos and then
# configuring, building, testing, and submitting results to CDash for the
# TriBITS packages in a project either in package-by-package mode (the
# default), or in an all-at-once mode (see
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_DO_ALL_AT_ONCE``).
#
# **Source and Binary Directory Locations:**
#
# To understand how to set the source and binary directories, one must
# understand that it gets run in one of two different modes:
#
# **Mode 1**: Run where there are already existing source and binary
# directories (i.e. ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`` is set empty before call).  In
# this case, ``CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`` and ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`` must be
# set by the user before calling this function.  This is used to test a local
# build and post to CDash (see the custom ``dashboard`` target).
#
# **Mode 2**: A new binary directory is created and new sources are cloned (or
# updated) in a driver directory (i.e. ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`` is set before
# call).  In this case, there are always two (partial) project source tree's,
# a) a "driver" skeleton source tree (typically embedded with TriBITS
# directory) that bootstraps the testing process, and b) a true full "source"
# that is (optionally) cloned and/or updated and tested..
#
# There are a few different directory locations are significant for this
# script:
#
#   ``TRIBITS_PROJECT_ROOT``
#
#     The root directory to an existing source tree where the project's
#     `<projectDir>/ProjectName.cmake`_ (defining the ``PROJECT_NAME``
#     variable) and ``Version.cmake`` files can be found.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TRIBITS_DIR``
#
#     The base directory for the TriBITS system's various CMake modules,
#     python scripts, and other files.  By default this is assumed to be in
#     the source tree under ``${TRIBITS_PROJECT_ROOT}`` (see below) but it can
#     be overridden to point to any location.
#
#   ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT``
#
#     If set, this is the base directory where this script runs that clones
#     the sources for the project.  If this directory does not exist, it will
#     be created.  If provided as the special value "PWD", then the present
#     working directory is used.  If empty, then this var has no effect.
#
#   ``CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY``
#
#     Determines the location of the sources that are used to define packages,
#     dependencies and configure, build, and test the software.  This is a
#     variable that CTest directly reads and must therefore be set. This is
#     used to set `PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR`_ which is used by the TriBITS system.
#     If ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`` is set, then this is hard-coded internally
#     to ``${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}/${CTEST_SOURCE_NAME}``.
#
#   ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY``
#
#     Determines the location of the binary tree where output from CMake/CTest
#     is put.  This is used to set to `PROJECT_BINARY_DIR`_ which is used by
#     the TriBITS system.  If ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`` is set, then this is
#     hard-coded internally to ``${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}/BUILD``.
#
# **Determining What Packages Get Tested:**
#
# Before any testing is done, the set of packages to be tested is determined
# are determined.  By default, the set of packages to be tested is determined
# by the var:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES``
#
#     Determines the specific set of packages to test.  If left at the default
#     value of empty "", then `${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES`_ is set to
#     ``ON`` and that enables packages as described in
#     `<Project>_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES enables all PT (cond. ST) SE packages`_.
#     This variable can also be specified and read from from the env and can
#     use `,` to separate package names instead of ';'.
#
# ToDo: Document other variables that determine what packages get tested.
#
# The other mode is to only test the packages that have changes since the last
# time this build was run and testing packages that previously failed.  That
# mode is turned on by the var:
#
#   ``CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then only packages that have changes pulled from the git
#     repos since the last time the build ran will be tested (in addition to
#     packages that failed in the last build).  If ``FALSE``, the set of
#     packages to be tested is determined by ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`` and
#     other variables as described above.
#
# ToDo: Document other input variables that have defaults, to be set before,
# and can be overridden from the env.
#
# **All-at-once vs. package-by-package mode:**
#
# This function supports driving the configure, build, testing, and submitting
# to CDash of the packages in the TriBITS project either all-at-once or
# package-by-package, based on the value:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_DO_ALL_AT_ONCE``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then single calls to ``CTEST_CONFIGURE()``,
#     ``CTEST_BUILD()`` and ``CTEST_TEST()` are made for all of the packages
#     to be tested all at once with ``CTEST_SUBMIT()`` called after each of
#     these.  If ``FALSE`` then ``CTEST_CONFIGURE()``, ``CTEST_BUILD()`` and
#     ``CTEST_TEST()` and ``CTEST_SUBMIT()`` are called in a loop, once for
#     each package to be explicitly tested.
#
# Both the all-at-once mode and the package-by-package mode should produce
# equivalent builds of the project and submits to CDash (for correctly
# constructed TriBITS projects and package).  But the package-by-package mode
# will disable failing packages when processing downstream packages, and
# therefore reduce the propagation of failures to downstream packages.
#
# For versions of CMake 3.10.0 and above and newer versions of CDash, the
# all-at-once mode will break down the build and test results on a
# package-by-package basis on CDash.  For older versions of CMake or CDash, it
# will not break down results on a package-by-package basis on CDash and all
# of the build warnings and errors and test will be all globed together.
#
# **Repository Updates:**
#
# Like the rest of TriBITS, ``ctest -S`` scripts written using this function
# supports a collection of extra repositories in addition to the base git
# repository.  The basic clone of the extra repositories requires all repos to
# use the git version control system.
#
# Whether the repos are updated (or left as is) is determined by the var:
#
#  ``CTEST_DO_UPDATES``
#
#    If set to ``TRUE``, then each of the git repos will be cloned if they are
#    missing and if already present will be updated as described below (and
#    will wipe out any local changes).  If ``FALSE``, then the git repos will
#    be left alone (and must therefore already be cloned and updated at the
#    desired state).
#
# **WARNING:** If you don't want local changes in your git repos to get blown
# away, then set ``CTEST_DO_UPDATES`` to ``FALSE``!
#
# CTest itself is used for handling the cloning and the pull of the base
# repository by calling ``CTEST_UPDATE()``.  The other extra git repositories
# are completely handled by the code in this function as described below.
#
# After the base repository is cloned for the first time (by calling
# ``CTEST_UPDATE()``), the extra repositories are cloned using the following
# command::
#
#   git clone <extrarepo_url>
# 
# Therefore, by default, whatever the default branch is set to on clone in the
# base repos, that is the branch that will be used.  Also, future repository
# updates will be done on those branches.
#
# However, if ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` is set to non-empty, then that branch
# will be checked out in all of the repositories.  For the base repository,
# after the clone or update is performed in the call to ``CTEST_UPDATE()``,
# then that branch is checked out using the command::
#
#   $ git checkout -B ${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH} \
#       --track origin/${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH}`
#
# That command is robust and will pass even if the current branch is already a
# tracking branch for ``origin/${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH}``.
#
# If ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` is empty, then each extra repository is
# updated (even after the initial clone) using the commands::
#
#   $ git clean -fdx         # Remove untracked ignored files
#   $ git reset --hard HEAD  # Removed untracked and modified tracked files
#   $ git fetch origin       # Get updated commits
#   $ git reset --hard @{u}  # Deal with forced push
#
# The command ``git clone -fdx`` removes any untracked ignored files that may
# have been created since the last update (either by the build process or by
# someone messing around in that local git repository).  The command ``git
# reset --hard HEAD`` removes any untracked non-ignored files, any modified
# tracked files, and sets ``ORIG_HEAD`` to the current ``HEAD``.  This sets
# ``ORIG_HEAD`` after the initial clone (as ``ORIG_HEAD`` is not set after a
# ``git clone``).  This allows using the range ``ORIG_HEAD..HEAD`` with git
# diff and log commands even after the initial clone.  The ``git fetch``
# command followed by the ``git reset --hard @{u}`` command is used to update
# the local repo to match the remote tracking branch instead of ``git pull` or
# ``git fetch ; git merge @{u}``.  This is done to deal with a possible forced
# push of the remote tracking branch.  Using ``git fetch ; git reset --hard
# @{u}`` ensures that the local branch is exactly the same the remote tracking
# branch no matter what.
#
# If ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` is non-empty, then each extra repository is
# updated (even after the initial clone) using the commands::
#
#   $ git clean -fdx         # Remove untracked ignored files
#   $ git reset --hard HEAD  # Clean files and set ORIG_HEAD to HEAD
#   $ git fetch origin       # Get updated commits
#   $ git checkout -B ${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH} \
#       --track origin/${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH}  # Put on tracking branch
#
# These are the same commands as for the case where ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH``
# is empty except for the last command which does a checkout of the tracking
# branch ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH``.  In this case, the ``git reset --hard
# HEAD`` serves an additional purpose.  It sets ``ORIG_HEAD`` to the current
# ``HEAD`` before the update of the branch.  This is important because the
# command ``git checkout -B ...`` does not move ``ORIG_HEAD`` so this reset is
# needed so that the git range ``ORIG_HEAD..HEAD`` gives the changes since the
# last update.  So for an update where no new commits are pulled,
# ``ORIG_HEAD..HEAD`` will return no commits.
#
# Note that the repository updating approach using non-empty
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` is more robust, because it can recover from a
# state where someone may have put A repo on a detached head or checked out a
# different branch.  One of these repos might get into this state when a
# person is messing around in the Nightly build and source directories to try
# to figure out what happened and forgot to put the repos back on the correct
# tracking branch.  Therefore, it is recommended to always set
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` to a non-null value like ``master`` for git
# repos.
#
# ToDo: Finish Documentation!
