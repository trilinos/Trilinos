#   # Call the driver script to handle the rest
#   tribits_ctest_driver()
#
# This platform independent code is used in CTest -S scripts to drive the
# testing process for submitting to CDash for a TriBITS project.
#
# This function drives the following operations:
# 
# 1) **Clone or update all source version control (VC) repos** (Only if
#    `CTEST_DO_UPDATES`_ ``= TRUE``, otherwise existing source tree pointed to
#    by `CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`_ must already be in place).  Submit "Update"
#    data to CDash.
#
# 2) **Empty the build directory** pointed to by `CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`_
#    (only if `CTEST_DO_NEW_START`_ ``= TRUE`` and
#    `CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY`_ ``= TRUE``).
#
# 3) **Generate the file <Project>PackageDependencies.xml** which is needed to
#    determine which packages need to be tested based on changes (only if
#    `CTEST_GENERATE_OUTER_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE`_ ``= TRUE``).
#
# 4) **Generate the file CDashSubprojectDependencies.xml** (only if
#    `CTEST_SUBMIT_CDASH_SUBPROJECTS_DEPS_FILE`_ ``= TRUE``).  Submit file to
#    CDash to inform of subproject structure and email addresses.
#
# 5) **Determine the set of packages to be tested**.  If
#    `CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY`_ ``= TRUE``, then this is
#    determined by the files that have changed since the last build and
#    therefore what TriBITS packages need to be tested (can only be used if
#    and the underlying source tree repos must are git repos).  Otherwise, one
#    can directly set `${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`_ and other variables (see
#    `Determining What Packages Get Tested (tribits_ctest_driver())`_).
#
# 6) **Start a new dashboard calling ctest_start()** which defines a new CDash
#    build (with a unique Build Stamp) (only if `CTEST_DO_NEW_START`_ ``=
#    TRUE``).
#
# 7) **Configure the selected packages to be tested** in the build directory
#    pointed to by `CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`_.  Submit "Configure" and "Notes"
#    data to CDash (only if `CTEST_DO_CONFIGURE`_ ``= TRUE``).
#
# 8) **Build configured packages and the enabled package tests**.  Submit
#    "Build" data to CDash (only if `CTEST_DO_BUILD`_ ``= TRUE``).
#
# 9) **Install the configured and build targets**.  Submit
#    "Build" install data to CDash (only if `CTEST_DO_INSTALL`_ ``= TRUE``).
#
# 10) **Run enabled tests for the configured packages** (only if
#     `CTEST_DO_TEST`_ = ``TRUE``).  (Also, this will generate coverage data if
#     `CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING`_ ``= TRUE``).  Submit "Test" data to CDash.
#
# 11) **Collect coverage results from tests already run** (only if
#     `CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING`_ ``= TRUE``).  Submit "Coverage" data to
#     CDash.
#
# 12) **Run dynamic analysis testing on defined test suite** (e.g. run
#     ``valgrind`` with each of the test commands (only if
#     `CTEST_DO_MEMORY_TESTING`_ ``= TRUE``).  Submit "MemCheck" data to CDash.
#
# After each of these steps, results are submitted to CDash if
# `CTEST_DO_SUBMIT`_ ``= TRUE`` and otherwise no data is submitted to any
# CDash site (which is good for local debugging of CTest -S driver scripts).
# For the package-by-package mode these steps 7-11 for configure, build, and
# running tests shown above are actually done in a loop package-by-package
# with submits for each package to be tested.  For the all-at-once mode, these
# steps are done all at once for the selected packages to be tested and
# results are submitted to CDash all-at-once for all packages together (see
# `All-at-once versus package-by-package mode (tribits_ctest_driver())`_).
#
# For context for how this function is used, see:
#
# * `TriBITS CTest/CDash Driver`_
# * `How to submit testing results to a CDash site`_
#
# Also note that this function executes `Reduced Package Dependency
# Processing`_ so all of the files described in that process are read in while
# this function runs.  This processing is needed to determine the TriBITS
# package dependency graph and to determine the set of packages to be enabled
# or disabled when determining the set of packages to be tested.

#
# **List of all variables (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# .. _Setting variables (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Setting variables (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# Variables can be set to control the behavior of this function before the
# function is called.  Some variables must be set in the CTest -S driver
# script before calling this function ``tribits_ctest_driver()``.  Many
# variables have a default value that will work in most cases.
#
# In general, these variables fall into one of three different categories:
#
# * **Variables that must be set in the outer CTest -S driver script before
#   the TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake module is even included:** Many of these
#   can also be overridden from an env var of the same name.  There are very
#   few of these variables and they are specifically called out below.
#
# * **Variables with no default value that must set in the outer CTest -S
#   driver script after the TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake module is included
#   but before tribits_ctest_driver() is called:** There are very few of these
#   variables and in some cases, they may be optional.  These types of
#   variables will be called out below.
#
# * **Variables that can be are set before tribits_ctest_driver() is called
#   but have default values provided in the tribits_ctest_driver() function
#   and may look for env var overrides:** This comprises the majority of the
#   variables used in ``tribits_ctest_driver()``.  The variables that have
#   default values but allow for an override as an env var use the function
#   `set_default_and_from_env()`_.  In the case of variables that are given a
#   default value with ``set_default_and_from_env()``, their value is always
#   overridden with what is in the env var of the same name.  In this case,
#   the overriding value that is read in from the env is printed out.  In
#   either case, the value used for these variables is printed out.
#
# Which variables are which are described below for each variable.
#
# .. _Source and Binary Directory Locations (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Source and Binary Directory Locations (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# To understand how to set the source and binary directories, one must
# understand that CTest -S scripts using this function get run in one of two
# different modes:
#
# **Mode 1**: Run where there are **already existing source and binary
# directories** (i.e.  is set empty before call).  In this case,
# `CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`_ and `CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`_ must be set by the
# user before calling this function (and `CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`_ is empty).
# This mode is typically used to test a local build or an existing cloned and
# setup set source tree and post to CDash (see the custom ``dashboard`` target
# in `Dashboard Submissions`_).
#
# **Mode 2**: A **new binary directory is created and optionally new sources
# are cloned or updated** under a driver directory
# (i.e. ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`` is set before call and that directory will be
# created if it does not already exist).  In this case, there are typically
# two (partial) project source tree's, a) the "driver" skeleton source tree
# (typically with an embedded tribits/ directory) that bootstraps the testing
# process that contains the CTest -S driver script, and b) the full "source"
# tree that is (optionally) cloned and/or updated and is directly configured,
# build, and tested.  This mode can also handle the case where the source tree
# is already set up in the location pointed to by `CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`_
# and `CTEST_DO_SUBMIT`_ is set to ``FALSE`` so this mode can get away with a
# single source tree and can handle a variety of use cases that may
# pre-manipulate the source tree before ``tribits_ctest_driver()`` is run.
#
# There are a few different directory locations that are significant for this
# script used in one or both of the modes described above:
#
#   .. _TRIBITS_PROJECT_ROOT:
#
#   ``TRIBITS_PROJECT_ROOT=<projectDir>``.
#
#     The root directory to an existing source tree where the project's
#     `<projectDir>/ProjectName.cmake`_ (defining the ``PROJECT_NAME``
#     variable) and `<projectDir>/Version.cmake`_ files can be found.  This
#     can be set() in the CTest -S script or override as an env var.  The
#     default and env override is set for this during the include() of the
#     module ``TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake``.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TRIBITS_DIR=<tribits-dir>``
#
#     The base directory for the TriBITS system's various CMake modules,
#     python scripts, and other files.  By default this is assumed to be
#     ``${TRIBITS_PROJECT_ROOT}/cmake/tribits``.  This can be set() in the
#     CTest -S script or overridden as an env var.  The default and env
#     override is set for this during the include() of
#     ``TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT:
#
#   ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT=<dashboard-root-dir>``
#
#     If set, this is the base directory where this script runs that clones
#     the sources for the project.  If this directory does not exist, it will
#     be created.  If provided as the special value ``PWD``, then the present
#     working directory is used.  If empty, then this var has no effect.  This
#     can be set() in CTest -S script before the call to
#     ``tribits_ctest_driver()`` or override as an env var.
#
#   .. _CTEST_SOURCE_NAME:
#
#   ``CTEST_SOURCE_NAME=<src-dir-name>``
#
#     The name of the source directory.  This can be set() in the CTest -S
#     script before the call to ``tribits_ctest_driver()`` or overridden as an
#     env var. By default, this is set to ``${PROJECT_NAME}``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY:
#
#   ``CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY=<src-dir-full-path>``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that determines the location of the sources that
#     are used to define packages, dependencies and configure, build, and test
#     the software.  This is a variable that CTest directly reads and must
#     therefore be set. This is used to set `PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR`_ which is
#     used by the TriBITS system.  If ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`` is set, then
#     this is hard-coded internally to
#     ``${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}/${CTEST_SOURCE_NAME}`` and will therefore
#     override any value that might be set in the CTest -S driver script.
#     However, if ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT`` is empty when
#     ``TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake`` is included(), then by default it set
#     to ``${TRIBITS_PROJECT_ROOT}``.  This can only be set() in the CTest -S
#     driver script and is not overridden as an env var.  The only way to
#     override in the ENV is to indirectly set through
#     ``${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY:
#
#   ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY=<binary-dir-full-path>``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that determines the location of the binary tree
#     where output from CMake/CTest is put.  This is used to set to
#     `PROJECT_BINARY_DIR`_ which is used by the TriBITS system and this
#     variable is directly ready by CTest itself.  If ``CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT``
#     is set, then this is hard-coded internally to
#     ``${CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT}/BUILD`` (overwriting any existing value of
#     ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY``).  If ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`` is empty
#     when ``TribitsCTestDriverCore.cmake`` is included(), then by default it
#     set to ``$ENV{PWD}/BUILD``.  ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`` can not be
#     overridden in the env.
#
# .. _Determining What Packages Get Tested (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Determining What Packages Get Tested (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# Before any testing is done, the set of packages to be tested is determined.
# This determination uses the basic `TriBITS Dependency Handling Behaviors`_
# and logic.  By default, the set of packages to be tested and otherwise
# explicitly processed is determined by the vars (which can also be set as env
# vars):
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES=<pkg0>,<pkg1>,...``
#
#     A semi-colon ';' or comma ',' separated list of packages that determines
#     the specific set of packages to test.  If left at the default value of
#     empty "", then `${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES`_ is set to ``ON``
#     and that enables packages as described in `<Project>_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES
#     enables all PT (cond. ST) packages`_.  This variable can use ',' to
#     separate package names instead of ';'.  The default value is empty "".
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES=<pkg0>,<pkg1>,...``
#
#     If ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`` is empty (and therefore
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_PACKAGES=ON`` is set), then additional
#     packages not enabled in that logic can be listed
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ADDITIONAL_PACKAGES`` and they will be tested as well.
#     For example, if this wold be used when there are some additional ST or
#     EX packages that should be tested in a PT build
#     (e.g. ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_SECONDARY_TESTED_CODE=FALSE``.  The
#     default value is empty "".
#
#  ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGE_ENABLES_FILE=<filepath>``
#
#    A file that is expected to define a set to `set()` statements to enable a
#    set of packages.  The set of packages enabled will determine what
#    packages are specifically processed and tested (according to other
#    options as well).  NOTE: To get this set of enables passed to inner
#    configure, also list this file in the inner configure cache variable
#    `${PROJECT_NAME}_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_FILE`_ (see passing such options
#    through in `Setting variables in the inner CMake configure
#    (tribits_ctest_driver())`_).  This is used instead of the variable
#    ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`` to specify the set of packages to enable and
#    test.  (If both ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`` and
#    ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGE_ENABLES_FILE`` are both set, then a fatal error
#    will occur.  The default value is empty "".
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If set to ``TRUE``, then all of the downstream packages from those
#     specified in ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`` will be enabled (see
#     `<Project>_ENABLE_ALL_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES enables downstream
#     packages/tests`_).  The default value is ``FALSE`` unless
#     ``CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY=TRUE`` is set in which case the
#     default value is ``TRUE``.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_SECONDARY_TESTED_CODE=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If set to ``TRUE``, then ST packages will get enabled in automated logic
#     in the outer determination of what packages to get tested.  This value
#     also gets passed to the inner CMake configure.  The default value is
#     ``OFF``.
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_EXCLUDE_PACKAGES:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXCLUDE_PACKAGES=<pkg0>,<pkg1>,...``
#
#     A semi-colon ';' or comma ',' separated list of packages **NOT** to
#     enable when determining the set of packages to be tested.  NOTE: Listing
#     packages here will *not* disable the package in the inner CMake
#     configure when using the package-by-packages approach.  To do that, you
#     will have to disable them in the variable EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS (set
#     in your driver script).  But for the all-at-once approach this list of
#     package disables **IS** pass into the inner configure.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_DISABLE_ENABLED_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If set to ``ON`` (or ``TRUE``), then if there are conflicts between
#     explicit enables and disables then explicit disables will override the
#     explicit enables (see `Disables trump enables where there is a
#     conflict`_).  The default is ``ON`` and likely should not be changed.
#     The default value is ``ON``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES:
#
#   ``CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If set to ``TRUE``, then all of the upstream packages for those selected
#     to be explicitly tested will be processed with results posted to CDash.
#     The default is ``TRUE`` unless
#     ``CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY==TRUE``.  Most builds that specify
#     a specific set of packages in ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`` should likely
#     set this to ``FALSE``.
#
# NOTE: Any and all of the above vars can be set as env vars and they will
# override the value set inside the CTest -S script with ``set()``` (or
# `set_default()`_) statements.  Also, for any of the vars that take a list,
# the CMake standard semi-colon char ';' can be used to separate list items or
# comas ',' can be used so that they can be used when setting env vars.  (The
# comas ',' are then replaced with semi-colons ';' internally before
# interpreted as an list by CMake.)
#
# The other mode for selecting the set of packages to be tested is to only
# test the packages that have changes since the last time this build was run
# and testing packages that previously failed.  That mode is turned on by the
# var:
#
#   .. _CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY:
#
#   ``CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then only packages that have changes pulled from the git
#     repos since the last time the build ran will be tested (in addition to
#     packages that failed in the last build).  If ``FALSE``, the set of
#     packages to be tested is determined by `${PROJECT_NAME}_PACKAGES`_ and
#     other variables as described above.
#
# .. _Setting variables in the inner CMake configure (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Setting variables in the inner CMake configure:**
#
# It is important to understand that none of the CMake vars that get set in
# the other CTest -S program that calls ``tribits_ctest_driver()``
# automatically get passed into the inner configure of the TriBITS CMake
# project using the ``ctest_configure()`` command by CMake.  From the
# perspective of raw CTest and CMake, these are completely separate programs.
# However, the ``tribits_ctest_driver()`` function will forward subset of
# variables documented below into the inner CMake configure.  The following
# variables that are set in the outer CTest -S program will be passed into the
# inner CMake configure by default (but their values they can be overridden by
# options listed in ``EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS`` or
# ``EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS``):
#
#   ``-D${PROJECT_NAME}_IGNORE_MISSING_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES=ON``
#
#     Missing extra repos are always ignored in the inner CMake configure.
#     This is because any problems reading an extra repo will be caught in the
#     outer CTest -S drivers script.
#
#   ``-D${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_ALL_OPTIONAL_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON``
#
#     Because of the behavior of the package-by-package mode, currently, this
#     is hard-coded to ``ON``.  (This set may be removed in the future for the
#     all-at-once mode.)
#
#   ``-D${PROJECT_NAME}_ALLOW_NO_PACKAGES:BOOL=ON``
#
#     This is currently set for the package-by-package mode since some
#     packages may get disabled because required upstream dependent packages
#     may be disabled.  (This set may be removed in the future for the
#     all-at-once mode.)
#
# The following variables set in the CTest -S driver script will be passed
# down into the inner CMake configure through the ``OPTIONS`` variable to the
# ``ctest_configure()`` command:
#
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TRIBITS_DIR``: Direct pass-through
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS_FLAGS``: Direct pass-through
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_DISABLE_ENABLED_FORWARD_DEP_PACKAGES``: Direct pass-through
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE``: Set to empty if
#   ``CTEST_GENERATE_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE==FALSE``
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_SECONDARY_TESTED_CODE``: Direct pass-through
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_TESTS``: Set the the same value as
#   `${PROJECT_NAME}_INNER_ENABLE_TESTS`_ set in the outer ctest -S driver script
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_SKIP_CTEST_ADD_TEST``: Direct pass-through
# * ``MPI_EXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS``: Direct pass-through
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING``: Set to ``ON`` if
#   ``CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING==TRUE``
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE``: Set to empty if
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE=NONE``. Otherwise, passed through.
# * ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE``: Direct pass-through
# * `${PROJECT_NAME}_GENERATE_VERSION_DATE_FILES`_: Only passed down if
#   non-empty value is set (default empty "")
#
# Arbitrary options can be set to be passed into the inner CMake configure
# after the above options are passed by setting the following variables:
#
#   .. _EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS:
#
#   ``EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS``
#
#     Additional list of system-specific options to be passed to the inner
#     CMake configure.  This must be set in the CTest -S driver script with a
#     ``set()`` statement (i.e. env var is not read).  These options get added
#     after all of the above pass-through options so they can override any of
#     those options.  **WARNING:** Do not include any semicolons ';' in these
#     arguments (see below WARNING).
#
#   .. _EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS:
#
#   ``EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS``
#
#     Additional list of extra cmake configure options to be passed to the
#     inner CMake configure.  This must be set in the CTest -S driver script
#     with a ``set()`` statement (i.e. env var is not read).  These options
#     get added after all of the above pass-through options and the options
#     listed in ``EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS`` so they can override any of
#     those options.  **WARNING:** Do not include any semicolons ';' in these
#     arguments (see below WARNING).
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS``:
#
#     A yet additional list of extra cmake configure options to be passed to
#     the inner CMake configure after all of the others.  Unlike the above
#     options, this var is read from the env and allows the user to set
#     arbitrary configure options that overrides all others. **WARNING:** Do
#     not include any semicolons ';' in these arguments (see below WARNING).
#
# These configure options are passed into the ``ctest_configure()`` command in
# the order::
#
#  <initial options> ${EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS}} \
#     ${EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS} ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS}
#
# **WARNING:** The options listed in ``EXTRA_SYSTEM_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS``,
# ``EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS``, and ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRA_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS``
# should not contain any semi-colons ';' or they will be interpreted as array
# bounds and mess up the arguments when passed to the inner CMake configure.
# To avoid problems with spaces and semicolons, it is usually a good idea to
# put these cache vars into ``*.cmake`` file fragments and the pass them
# through using the variable `<Project>_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_FILE`_ as::
#
#   -D<Project>_CONFIGURE_OPTIONS_FILE=<optionsfile1>.cmake,<optionsfile2>.cmake,...
#
# or using the built-in CMake option::
#
#   -C<abs-base>/<optionsfile1>.cmake -C<abs-base>/<optionsfile2>.cmake ...
#
# NOTE: The full list of options passed into the inner CMake is printed out
# before calling ``ctest_configure()`` so any issues setting options and the
# ordering of options can be seen in that printout.
#
# .. _Determining what testing-related actions are performed (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Determining what testing-related actions are performed (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# When run, ``tribits_ctest_driver()`` always performs a configure and build
# but other actions are optional.  By default, a version control update (or
# clone) is performed as well as running tests and submitting results to
# CDash.  But the version control update, the running tests and submitting
# results to CDash can be disabled.  Also, coverage testing and memory testing
# are not performed by default but they can be turned on with results
# submitted to CDash.  These actions are controlled by the following variables
# (which can be set in the CTest -S script before calling
# ``tribits_ctest_driver()`` and can be overridden by env vars of the same
# name):
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_NEW_START:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_NEW_START=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, ``ctest_start()`` is called to set up a new "dashboard"
#     (i.e. define a new CDash build with a unique Build Stamp defined in the
#     ``Testing/TAG`` file).  If ``FALSE``, then ``ctest_start(... APPEND)``
#     is called which allows it this ctest -S invocation to append results to
#     an existing CDash build.  (See ???).  Default ``TRUE``.
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_UPDATES=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then the source repos will be updated as specified in
#     `Repository Updates (tribits_ctest_driver())`_.  Default ``TRUE``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_UPDATE_ARGS:
#
#   ``CTEST_UPDATE_ARGS``
#
#     Any extra arguments to use with ``git clone`` to clone the base git repo.
#     The default value is empty "".  This is only used for the base git repo
#     (not the extra repos).
#
#   .. _CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_ONLY:
#
#   ``CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_ONLY``:
#
#    Built-in CTest variable that if set to ``TRUE`` will change the default
#    behavior of ``ctest_update()`` such that it will not clone or pull from
#    the remove repo or update the local branch in any way.  This also skips
#    any actions on extra repos and skips the creation of the ``Updates.txt``
#    or ``UpdateCommandsOutput.txt`` files.  Setting this to ``TRUE`` along
#    with ``CTEST_DO_UPDATES=ON`` and doing a submit to CDash will result
#    "Revision" column being present with the Git SHA1 of the base repo (and a
#    hyperlink to the commit in the public git repo).  This is useful when
#    using with a CI testing system that handles all of the git repo
#    manipulation like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins.
#
#   .. _CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY:
#
#   ``CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then if the binary directory ``${CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY}``
#     already exists, then it will be clean out using the CTest command
#     ``ctest_empty_binary_directory()``.  However, this can set to ``FALSE``
#     in which case a rebuild (using existing object files, libraries, etc.)
#     will be performed which is useful when using an incremental CI server.
#     But this is ignored if ``CTEST_DO_NEW_START=FALSE``. Default ``TRUE``
#     (which is the most robust option).
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_CONFIGURE:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_CONFIGURE=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then the selected packages will be configured.  If
#     ``FALSE``, it is assumed that a relevant configure is already in place
#     in the binary directory if a build or running tests is to be done.  Note
#     that for the package-by-package mode, a configure is always done if a
#     build or any testing is to be done but results will not be sent to CDash
#     unless ``CTEST_DO_CONFIGURE=TRUE``. Default ``TRUE``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_WIPE_CACHE:
#
#   ``CTEST_WIPE_CACHE=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then ``${CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY}/CMakeCache.txt`` and
#     ``${CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY}/CMakeFiles/`` will be deleted before
#     performing a configure.  (This value is set to ``FALSE`` by the `make
#     dashboard`_ target that does an experimental build, test, and submit to
#     CDash.)  Default ``TRUE`` (which is the most robust option in general).
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_BUILD:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_BUILD=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then the selected packages will be build.  If ``FALSE``, it
#     is assumed that a relevant build is already in place in the binary
#     directory if any testing is to be done.  Default ``TRUE``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS:
#
#   ``CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that gives the flags passed to the build command
#     called inside of the built-in CTest command ``ctest_build()``.  The
#     default is ``-j2`` when `CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR`_ is set to ``Unix
#     Makefiles``.  Otherwise, the default is empty "".  Useful options to set
#     are ``-j<N>`` (to build on parallel) and ``-k`` (to keep going when
#     there are build errors so we can see all of the build errors).  When
#     ``CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR`` is set to ``Ninja``, the ``j<N>`` option can
#     be left off (in which case all of the available unloaded cores are used
#     to build) and the option ``-k 999999`` can be used to build all targets
#     when there are build failures.
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_INSTALL:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_INSTALL=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then ``-DCMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY=ON`` will be
#     passed th the inner CMake configure and the 'install_package_by_package'
#     target will be built to install what has been configured and built by
#     the build step for the all-at-once mode
#     (i.e. ``${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_DO_ALL_AT_ONCE=TRUE``).  If ``FALSE``,
#     then ``-DCMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY=ON`` is **not** added to the
#     inner configure and no install is performed.  (NOTE: The cmake var
#     ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` must be set on the inner cmake configure for
#     this to work correctly.  Also, the install is currently not implemented
#     for the package-by-package mode
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_DO_ALL_AT_ONCE=FALSE`` and this option will
#     simply be ignored in that case.)  Default ``FALSE``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_TEST:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_TEST=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then ``ctest_test()`` will be called and test results will
#     be submitted to CDash.  This should be set to ``FALSE`` when one wanted
#     to only test the configure and build of a project but not run any tests
#     (e.g. when cross compiling or if the tests are too expensive to run).
#     The default value is ``TRUE``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL:
#
#   ``CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL=<num>``
#
#     The parallel level passed in the ``PARALLEL_LEVEL`` argument to
#     ``ctest_test()`` AND ``ctest_memcheck()``.  The default value is ``1``
#     (one).
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_INNER_ENABLE_TESTS:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_INNER_ENABLE_TESTS``
#
#     If ``OFF``, then ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_TESTS=OFF`` will be passed to
#     the inner CMake configure.  This will avoid building of all tests and
#     examples for the enabled packages and also no CTest tests will be
#     defined using calls to ``add_test()`` in the inner project configure.
#     This results in just the building of the libraries and non-test,
#     non-example executables (which will be much faster for some projects).
#     The default value is ``ON`` (in which case all of the test and example
#     executable and other targets will get built for all of the explicitly
#     enabled packages and the associated ctest tests will be defined and
#     run).
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_SKIP_CTEST_ADD_TEST:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_SKIP_CTEST_ADD_TEST``:
#
#     If set to ``TRUE``, then ``${PROJECT_NAME}_SKIP_CTEST_ADD_TEST=TRUE`` is
#     passed in to the inner CMake configure.  This will result in all of the
#     test and example executables for the enabled packages to be built but no
#     ctest tests will get defined and run by skipping the inner CMake calls
#     to ``add_test()``.  Setting this to ``TRUE`` allows all of the
#     libraries, production executables and the test and example executables
#     and other targets to get built, but no tests will be run.  However, when
#     ``CTEST_DO_TEST=ON``, the ``ctest_test()`` command will still be run and
#     test results will still be submitted to CDash which will report zero
#     tests.  This avoids the test results being reported as missing on CDash
#     for tools like ``ctest_analyze_and_report.py``.  The default value is
#     ``FALSE`` (in which case any enabled tests or examples in the explicitly
#     enabled packages will get run).
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_COVERAGE_TESTING=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then ``ctest_coverage()`` is called to collect coverage and
#     submit results generated from the previous ``ctest_test()`` command.
#     Setting this to ``TRUE`` also results in
#     ``-D${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_COVERAGE_TESTING=ON`` getting passed down to
#     the inner CMake configure of the project (i.e. so that the executables
#     are instrumented to generate coverage data when run by the tests in the
#     ``ctest_test()`` command).  (Default is ``OFF``)
#
#   .. _CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND:
#
#   ``CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that determines the command that is run by
#     ``ctest_coverage()`` to collect coverage results.  That default value is
#     ``gcov``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_MEMORY_TESTING:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_MEMORY_TESTING=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then ``ctest_memcheck()`` is called to run the test suite
#     with the memory checking tool and results submitted to CDash.
#
#   .. _CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND:
#
#   ``CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that determines the command that is used to run
#     the command for each test run by the ``ctest_memcheck()`` command.  If
#     ``valgrind`` is found on the local system, then that is used by default.
#     Otherwise, the default is empty "".
#
#   .. _CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS:
#
#   ``CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that determines what options are passed to the
#     memory checking command before the actual test command.  The default
#     value is empty "".
#
#   .. _CTEST_GENERATE_OUTER_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE:
#
#   ``CTEST_GENERATE_OUTER_DEPS_XML_OUTPUT_FILE=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then ``<Project>PackageDependencies.xml`` file will be
#     generated in the outer CTest -S program.  This file is used to help
#     determine what packages have changed and need to be tested when in CI
#     mode (e.g. when ``CTEST_ENABLE_MODIFIED_PACKAGES_ONLY=TRUE`` is set).
#     It is also needed to generate the ``CDashSubprojectDependencies.xml``
#     file that gets submitted to CDash to inform it of the list of
#     subprojects and subproject dependencies (i.e. TriBITS packages).  The
#     default value is ``TRUE``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_SUBMIT_CDASH_SUBPROJECTS_DEPS_FILE:
#
#   ``CTEST_SUBMIT_CDASH_SUBPROJECTS_DEPS_FILE=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then CDash subprojects XML file is generated and submitted
#     to CDash.  This file tells CDash about the subproject (i.e. TriBITS
#     package) structure.  The default value is ``TRUE``.
#
#   .. _CTEST_DO_SUBMIT:
#
#   ``CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then all of the results generated locally are submitted to
#     CDash using ``ctest_submit()``.  One can set this to ``FALSE`` when
#     locally debugging a CTest -S driver script to avoid spamming CDash.  The
#     default value is ``TRUE``.  (NOTE: This may submit to more than one
#     CDash site as noted in `Specifying where the results go to CDash
#     (tribits_ctest_driver())`_).
#
# .. _Determining how the results are displayed on CDash (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Determining how the results are displayed on CDash (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# These options all primarily determine how VC update, configure, build, test,
# and other results submitted are displayed on CDash (but not what CDash
# site(s) or project(s) to which they are submitted, see `Specifying where the
# results go to CDash (tribits_ctest_driver())`_).  These options can all be
# set in the CTest -S script using ``set()`` statements before
# ``tribits_ctest_driver()`` is called and can be overridden in the env when
# running the CTest -S driver script.
#
#   .. _CTEST_TEST_TYPE:
#
#   ``CTEST_TEST_TYPE=[Nightly|Continuous|Experimental]``
#
#     Determines the model for build.  This value is passed in as the first
#     argument to the built-in CTest function ``ctest_start()``.  Valid values
#     include ``Nightly``, ``Continuous``, and ``Experimental``.  As far as
#     CTest is concerned, the only real impact this CTest "Model" has is on
#     setting the time stamp in the build stamp field (which is stored in the
#     file ``Testing/TAG``).  For the model ``Nightly``, the time stamp in the
#     build stamp is taken from the variable ``CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME`` read
#     in from the file `<projectDir>/CTestConfig.cmake`_ file.  Otherwise, the
#     time stamp used is the current build start time.  (The reason this is
#     significant is that builds on CDash that have the same site, buildname,
#     and build stamp are considered the same build and will combine results.)
#     This also defines the default value for `${PROJECT_NAME}_TRACK`_ (see
#     below) as well as defines the default value for
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE``.  The default value
#     is ``Experimental``.
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_TRACK:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TRACK=<cdash-group>``
#
#     Specifies the testing track that specifies the CDash group for which
#     results are displayed under (i.e. the "Group" filter field on CDash).
#     This is the value used for the (deprecated) ``TRACK`` argument (renamed
#     ``GROUP`` in CMake/CTest versions 3.16+) of the built-in CTest function
#     ``ctest_start()``.  The default value is set to ``${CTEST_TEST_TYPE}``.
#     However, if ``CTEST_TEST_TYPE==Experimental`` (or ``EXPERIMENTAL``),
#     then ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TRACK`` is forced to ``Experimental``, even if it
#     was set to a different value.  The default value can also be set in the
#     ctest -S driver script itself by setting ``set(${PROJECT_NAME}_TRACK
#     <cdash-group>)``.  And, of course, if the environment variable ``export
#     <Project>_TRACK=<cdash-group>`` is set, then that value will be used for
#     the CDash Track/Group to submit results to.
#
#   .. _CTEST_SITE:
#
#   ``CTEST_SITE=<site-name>``
#
#     This is a built-in CTest variable that determines what is displayed for
#     the ``site`` field for the build on CDash.  This specified by default by
#     calling the built-in CMake/CTest function ``site_name()``.
#
#   .. _COMPILER_VERSION:
#
#   ``COMPILER_VERSION=<compiler-version>``
#
#     Gives the name of the compiler that is used to compose a default
#     `CTEST_BUILD_NAME`_.  If ``CTEST_BUILD_NAME`` is explicitly set, then
#     this value is ignored.
#
#   .. _CTEST_BUILD_NAME:
#
#   ``CTEST_BUILD_NAME=<build-name>``
#
#     This is a built-in CTest variable that determines the name of the build
#     on CDash.  Builds that have the same ``CTEST_SITE``,
#     ``CTEST_BUILD_NAME`` and ``${PROJECT_NAME}_TRACK`` are considered to be
#     related builds and CDash will relate them as "previous" and "next"
#     builds (good for showing number of added or removed tests, new test
#     failures, new passing tests, etc.).  If not specified, it is given the
#     default value ``${HOST_TYPE}-${COMPILER_VERSION}-${BUILD_DIR_NAME}``.
#     Here, ``HOST_TYPE`` is determined automatically from the ``uname``
#     system command using ``find_program(uname)``.  The value of
#     ``BUILD_DIR_NAME`` is expected to be set in each specific CTest -S
#     driver script.
#
#   .. _CTEST_NOTES_FILES:
#
#   ``CTEST_NOTES_FILES="<filepath1>;<filepath2>;..."``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that specifies a semi-colon separated list of
#     files that will get uploaded to CDash as "notes files".  This function
#     will also add notes files as well such as the file
#     ``CMakeCache.clean.txt`` (cleaned-up version of the CMakeCache.txt
#     file), the file ``Updates.txt`` (lists new git commits pulled in all the
#     git repos), the file ``UpdateCommandsOutput.txt`` (list of commands and
#     their output which are run by ``ctest_update()`` in the base git repo),
#     and the file ``${PROJECT_NAME}RepoVersion.txt`` (gives version of all
#     the git repos being tested).
#
#   .. _CTEST_CHANGE_ID:
#
#   ``CTEST_CHANGE_ID``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that can be used to set to an integer for the
#     GitHub Pull Request (PR) ID or GitLab Merge Request (MR) ID (or other
#     such repository and development management system's change control ID).
#     If the CDash project is properly configured to point to the GitHub or
#     GitLab (or other supported) repository for the project, then CDash will
#     put a hyper-linked icon beside the build name that links back to the PR
#     or MR issue with that ID.  It may also be used for other purposes as
#     well in the future.
#
# .. _Specifying where the results go to CDash (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Specifying where the results go to CDash (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# By default, the target CDash server and CDash project are specified by the
# variables set in the file `<projectDir>/CTestConfig.cmake`_; specifically,
# ``CTEST_DROP_SITE``, ``CTEST_PROJECT_NAME``, and ``CTEST_DROP_LOCATION``.
# If these are set using `set_default_and_from_env()`_, as shown in the
# example ``TribitsExampleProject/CTestConfig.cmake`` file, then they can be
# overridden with ``set()`` statements in the CTest -S script or as env vars;
# simple enough.
#
# In addition, results can be sent to a second CDash site using the variables:
#
#   ``TRIBITS_2ND_CTEST_DROP_SITE``
#
#     CDash drop site for second upload of results.  If empty, then
#     ``CTEST_DROP_SITE`` is used.
#
#   ``TRIBITS_2ND_CTEST_DROP_LOCATION``
#
#     Location for the second drop site.  If empty, then
#     ``CTEST_DROP_LOCATION`` is used.
#
# At lease one of these vars must be set to non empty or a second submit will
# not be performed.  For more details, see `TRIBITS_2ND_CTEST_DROP_SITE`_ and
# `TRIBITS_2ND_CTEST_DROP_LOCATION`_.
#
# .. _Links to results on CDash (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Links to results on CDash (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# Links to where the results will be posted on CDash are printed to STDOUT
# before it performs any actions and at end after all of the actions and
# submits have been completed.
#
# The results are printed to STDOUT in a section that looks like::
#
#   Link to this build's results on CDash:
#
#     <cdash-build-url>
#
#   Link to all builds for this repo version on CDash:
#
#     <cdash-revision-builds-url>
#
#   Link to all nonpassing tests for all builds for this repo version on CDash:
#
#     <cdash-revision-nonpassing-tests-url>
#
# The URL ``<cdash-build-url>`` is created from the buildname, site, and
# buildstartime fields which is known from the TAG file created by CTest.
# This allows access the results for this particular build on CDash by just
# clicking that link.
#
# The URL ``<cdash-revision-builds-url>`` provides a link to a CDash
# ``index.php`` query that includes all of the builds with the same base Git
# repo SHA1.  This allows comparing the results of this build for other builds
# for this same version of the base Git repository.
#
# The URL ``<cdash-revision-nonpassing-tests-url>`` gives a link to a CDash
# ``queryTests.php`` query for all of the nonpassing tests for all of the
# builds with this same base project Git repo SHA1.  This allows comparing
# test failures across all of the builds for the same base project Git repo
# version.
#
# NOTE: The links ``<cdash-revision-builds-url>`` and
# ``<cdash-revision-nonpassing-tests-url>`` are only provided if the base
# project Git repo has the ``.git/`` subdirectory and if ``git log``
# successfully returns the SHA1 for that base Git repo.
#
# NOTE: The links ``<cdash-revision-builds-url>`` and
# ``<cdash-revision-nonpassing-tests-url>`` only consider the Git SHA1 of the
# base project Git repo.  For multi-repo projects (see `Multi-Repository
# Support`_), you may get results for builds with different subrepo versions
# and therefore may be comparing apples and oranges.  (Projects that commit a
# ``<Project>SubRepoVersion.txt`` file to their base Git repo or use Git
# Submodules will have unique base project Git repo SHA1s for different
# versions of the project's repos.)
#
# In addition, a text file ``CDashResults.txt`` will be written in the build
# directory that contains this same CDash link information shown above.  This
# allows a process to cat the file ``CDashResults.txt`` to get links to the
# results on CDash.
#
# .. _Determining what TriBITS repositories are included (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Determining what TriBITS repositories are included (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# This script is set up to process extra VC and TriBITS repos that contribute
# additional TriBITS packages to the base TriBITS project.  This set of extra
# repos is determined using the following vars (which can be set in the CTest
# -S script or overridden with env vars of the same name):
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE=<extrarepos-file-path>``
#
#     Points to a file that lists the extra VC and TriBITS repos. If not
#     explicitly set, then by default it will read from the file
#     `<projectDir>/cmake/ExtraRepositoriesList.cmake`_ unless
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_SKIP_EXTRAREPOS_FILE=TRUE`` is set in the
#     ``ProjectName.cmake`` file in which case no extra repos file is read in.
#     See `<Project>_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`_.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE=[Nightly|Continuous|Experimental]``
#
#     The category of extra repos to process from the file
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`` (see
#     `<Project>_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE`_).
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_PRE_REPOSITORIES=<reponame1>,<reponame2>,...``
#
#     Subset of "pre" extra repos specified in the file
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`` to process (see
#     `<Project>_PRE_REPOSITORIES`_).
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES=<reponame1>,<reponame2>,...``
#
#     Subset of "post" extra repos specified in the file
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`` to process (see
#     `<Project>_EXTRA_REPOSITORIES`_).
#
# The behavior for selecting extra repos using these variables is determined
# as described in:
#
# * `Enabling extra repositories through a file`_
#
# .. _All-at-once versus package-by-package mode (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **All-at-once versus package-by-package mode (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# This function supports driving the configure, build, testing, and submitting
# to CDash of the packages in the TriBITS project either all-at-once or
# package-by-package, based on the vars (which can be set in the CTest -S
# script and overridden by env vars):
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_DO_ALL_AT_ONCE=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     If ``TRUE``, then single calls to ``ctest_configure()``,
#     ``ctest_build()`` and ``ctest_test()`` are made for all of the packages
#     to be tested all at once with ``ctest_submit()`` called after each of
#     these.  If ``FALSE`` then ``ctest_configure()``, ``ctest_build()`` and
#     ``ctest_test()`` and ``ctest_submit()`` are called in a loop, once for
#     each package to be explicitly tested. 
#
# Both the all-at-once mode and the package-by-package mode should produce
# equivalent builds of the project and submits to CDash (for correctly
# constructed TriBITS projects and packages).  But the package-by-package mode
# will disable packages with failing library builds when processing downstream
# packages, and therefore reduce the propagation of failures to downstream
# packages and therefore is more robust.  But the package-by-package mode is
# more expensive in several respects for many projects.
#
# For versions of CMake 3.17.0 and above and newer versions of CDash, the
# CDash server for the all-at-once mode will break down build and test results
# on a package-by-package basis on CDash together.
#
# .. _Multiple ctest -S invocations (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Multiple ctest -S invocations (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# By default, this function is meant to be used in a single invocation of the
# ``ctest -S <script>.cmake`` command in order to do everything from the
# beginning and submit to CDash.  But there are times when one needs to do the
# various steps in multiple ``ctest -S`` invocations that all send data to the
# same CDash build.  For example, on some clusters, configure and build must
# be done on "compile nodes" but the tests must be run on "compute nodes".
# Typically, these types of machines have a shared file system.  On a system
# like this, one would use two different invocations as::
#
#   # Start new dashboard, update, configure, and build on compile node
#   env CTEST_DO_TEST=OFF \
#     ctest -S <script>.cmake
#
#   # Run tests only on compute node
#   <run-on-compute-node> \
#     env CTEST_DO_NEW_START=OFF CTEST_DO_UPDATES=OFF \
#       CTEST_DO_CONFIGURE=OFF CTEST_DO_BUILD=OFF \
#       CTEST_DO_TEST=ON \
#     ctest -S <script>.cmake
#
# Above, `CTEST_DO_NEW_START`_ ``= OFF`` is needed to ensure that the test
# results go to the same CDash build.  (NOTE: A CDash build is uniquely
# determined by the site name, build name and build stamp.)
#
# This approach works for both the all-at-once mode and the package-by-package
# mode.
#
# Also, one can run each of the basic steps in its own ``ctest -S`` invocation
# starting with ``CTEST_DO_NEW_START = ON``, then `CTEST_DO_UPDATES`_ ``=
# ON``, then `CTEST_DO_CONFIGURE`_ ``= ON``, then `CTEST_DO_BUILD`_ ``= ON``,
# then then `CTEST_DO_TEST`_ ``= ON``, etc.  While there is typically no
# reason to split things up to this level of granularity, CTest and this
# ``tribits_ctest_driver()`` function will support such usage.  All that is
# required is that those steps be performed in that order.  For example, one
# cannot do a build in one ``ctest -S`` invocation and then try to do a
# configure in the next because the build will fail because a valid
# configuration has not been performed yet.  And one cannot run just tests if
# there is not a valid configuration and build already in place.
#
# .. _Repository Updates (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Repository Updates (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# Like the rest of TriBITS, ``ctest -S`` scripts written using this function
# support a collection of extra repositories in addition to the base git
# repository.
#
# Whether the local repos are updated (or left as is) is determined by the
# variable:
#
#  .. _CTEST_DO_UPDATES:
#
#  ``CTEST_DO_UPDATES=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#    If set to ``TRUE``, then each of the git repos will be cloned if they do
#    not already exist and if already present will be updated as described
#    below (and will wipe out any local changes).  If set to ``FALSE``, then
#    the git repos will be left alone and must therefore already be cloned and
#    updated at the desired state.  For example, this should be set to
#    ``FALSE`` when running against a local development repo (e.g. the `make
#    dashboard`_ target sets this to ``FALSE`` automatically) or when other
#    logic is used to setup the source directories. **WARNING:** If you are
#    running against a local repo with local changes and you don't set to
#    ``FALSE``, then your local uncommitted changes will be wiped out and the
#    local branch will be hard reset to the remote tracking branch!  The
#    default value is ``TRUE``.
#
# **WARNING:** If you don't want local changes in your git repos to get blown
# away, then set ``CTEST_DO_UPDATES`` to ``FALSE``!
#
# If the base repo pointed to by ``${CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY}`` is missing, it
# cloned inside of the ``ctest_start()`` function using the custom command::
#
#   git clone [-b ${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH}] \
#     -o ${${PROJECT_NAME}_GIT_REPOSITORY_REMOTE} \
#     ${${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_LOCATION}
#
# where:
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_LOCATION:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_LOCATION=<repo-url>``
#
#     The URL of the base git repo ``<repo-url>`` to clone inside of
#     ``ctest_start()``.  The default is
#     ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_LOCATION_NIGHTLY_DEFAULT}`` when
#     ``CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Nightly`` and otherwise the default is
#     ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_LOCATION_DEFAULT}``.
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_GIT_REPOSITORY_REMOTE:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_GIT_REPOSITORY_REMOTE=<remote-name>``
#
#     The git remote name given to the cloned repo.  This is needed for robust
#     git operations as described below (Default 'origin').  If a repo is
#     already cloned, then a remote in the already existing repo must exist
#     with this name or 
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH=<branch>``
#
#     The branch of the base repo to explicitly checkout after clone (and on
#     each update).  The value of empty "" is allowed which results in the
#     default branch being checked out on clone (and the ``-b <branch>``
#     argument to be omitted from the ``git clone`` command).  The default
#     value determined by the variable
#     ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_BRANCH}}``.  The default value for
#     ``${PROJECT_NAME}_REPOSITORY_BRANCH`` is empty.
#
# If the base repo already exists, no initial clone is performed and it is
# assumed that it is in a state to allow it to be updated as described below.
#
# After the base repo is cloned, any missing extra git repositories are cloned
# using CMake/CTest code in this ``tribits_ctest_driver()`` function (raw
# CTest does not support cloning a list of extra repos) using the command::
#
#   git clone [-b ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPO_BRANCH}] \
#     -o ${${PROJECT_NAME}_GIT_REPOSITORY_REMOTE} \
#     <extrarepo_url>
#
# where:
#
#   .. _${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_BRANCH:
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_BRANCH=<extrarepo-branch>``
#
#     The branch ``<extrarepo-branch>`` that each extra VC repo that is
#     checked out.  The default value is set to ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH}``.
#     If empty "", then the ``-b <branch>`` argument is omitted from the ``git
#     clone`` command.  (NOTE: Checking out a separate branch on the extra
#     repos from the base repo was needed for backward compatibility for the
#     Trilinos project and is not recommended usage as it violates the "single
#     branch" approach for using `gitdist`_.)
#
#   ``<extrarepo_url>``
#
#     The git repo remote URL given in the file
#     `${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPOS_FILE`_.
#
# When ``CTEST_DO_UPDATES=TRUE`` (after a possible initial clone), the
# function ``ctest_update()`` is called to update the base git repo.  The base
# git repo is updated with the custom git commands executed inside of the
# ``ctest_update()`` using::
#
#   $ git fetch ${${PROJECT_NAME}_GIT_REPOSITORY_REMOTE}
#   $ git clean -fdx         # Remove untracked ignored files
#   $ git reset --hard HEAD  # Clean files and set ORIG_HEAD to HEAD
#   $ git checkout -B ${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH} \
#       --track origin/${${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH}   # Sets HEAD
#
# The above set of commands are the maximally robust way to update a git repo.
# They will correct any local state of the local repo and will put the local
# repo on the requested local tracking branch.  It can handled hard-reset
# remote branches, previous tracking branch now missing, etc.  The only
# requirement is that the remote repo pointed to at
# ``${${PROJECT_NAME}_GIT_REPOSITORY_REMOTE}`` is valid and has not changed
# since the repo was first cloned.  (NOTE: A future version of TriBITS may
# automate the update of this git remote.)
#
# If ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` is empty "", the last ``git checkout -B
# <branch> ...`` command is replaced with the git command::
#
#   $ git reset --hard @{u}  # Sets HEAD
#
# After the base git repo is updated inside of ``ctest_update()`` as described
# above, each of the extra repos is updated using a similar set of git
# commands::
#
#   $ git fetch ${${PROJECT_NAME}_GIT_REPOSITORY_REMOTE}
#   $ git clean -fdx         # Remove untracked ignored files
#   $ git reset --hard HEAD  # Clean files and set ORIG_HEAD to HEAD
#   $ git checkout -B ${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPO_BRANCH} \
#       --track origin/${${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPO_BRANCH}  # Sets HEAD
#
# where if ``${PROJECT_NAME}_EXTRAREPO_BRANCH`` is empty, the last ``git
# checkout -B <branch> ...`` command replaced with::
#
#   $ git reset --hard @{u}
#
# **WARNING:** This version of the ``git checkout -B <branch> ...`` command
# is not supported in older versions of git.  Therefore, a newer version of
# git is required when using named branches.
#
# The command ``git clone -fdx`` removes any untracked ignored files that may
# have been created since the last update (either by the build process or by
# someone messing around in that local git repository).  The command ``git
# reset --hard HEAD`` removes any untracked non-ignored files, any modified
# tracked files, and sets ``ORIG_HEAD`` to the current ``HEAD``.  This sets
# ``ORIG_HEAD`` after the initial clone (which is needed since ``ORIG_HEAD``
# is not set after the initial ``git clone`` command).  This allows using the
# range ``ORIG_HEAD..HEAD`` with ``git diff`` and ``git log`` commands even
# after the initial clone.  (Directly after the initial clone, the range
# ``ORIG_HEAD..HEAD`` will be empty). The git commands ``git checkout -B
# <branch> <remote>/<branch>`` or ``git reset --hard @{u}`` are used to update
# the local repo to match the remote tracking branch.  This is done to deal
# with a possible forced push of the remote tracking branch or even changing
# to different tracking branch (when using an explicit ``<branch>`` name).
#
# Note that the repository updating approach described above using non-empty
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` is more robust, because it can recover from a
# state where someone may have put a repo on a detached head or checked out a
# different branch.  One of these repos might get into this state when a
# person is messing around in the Nightly build and source directories to try
# to figure out what happened and forgot to put the repos back on the correct
# tracking branch.  Therefore, it is recommended to always set an explicit
# ``${PROJECT_NAME}_BRANCH`` to a non-null value like ``master`` or
# ``develop`` for the git repos, even if this branch is the default repo
# branch.
#
# .. _Other CTest Driver options (tribits_ctest_driver()):
#
# **Other CTest Driver options (tribits_ctest_driver()):**
#
# Other miscellaneous vars that can be set in the CTest -S script or as env
# vars are given below.
#
#   .. _CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR:
#
#   ``CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR="[Unix Makefiles|Ninja|..]"``
#
#     Built-in CTest variable that determines the CMake generator used in the
#     inner configure.  If an existing ``CMakeCache.txt`` file exists, then
#     the default value for the generator will be read out of that file.
#     Otherwise, the default generator is selected to be ``Unix Makefiles``.
#     Another popular option is ``Ninja``.  The value of this variable
#     determines the type of generator used in the inner CMake configure done
#     by the command ``ctest_configure(...)`` called in this function.  This
#     is done implicitly by CTest.  The selected generator has an impact on
#     what flags can be used in `CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS`_ since ``make`` and
#     ``ninja`` accept different arguments in some cases.
#
#   ``${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=[TRUE|FALSE]``
#
#     Puts TriBITS configure into development mode (vs. release mode) in the
