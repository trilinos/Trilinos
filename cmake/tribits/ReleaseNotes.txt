Release Notes for TriBITS
----------------------------------------
2017/09/25:

(*) MINOR: Added cache and enve vars CTEST_SUBMIT_RETRY_COUNT and
    CTEST_SUBMIT_RETRY_DELAY to allow the number of ctest_submit() submit
    attemtps to retry and how how log to pause between retries.  Before, these
    were hard-coded to 25 and 120 respectively, which means that something
    like a MySQL insertion error could consume as much as 50 minutes befor
    moving on!  The new defalts are set at 5 retries with a 3 sec delay (which
    appear to be the CTest defaults).

2017/09/30:

(*) MINOR: Added TEST_<IDX> COPY_FILES_TO_TEST_DIR block for
    TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST().  This was added in such a way so to avoid
    clashing with existing usages of the script (since the new arguments
    SOURCE_DIR and DEST_DIR are only parsed if COPY_FILES_TO_TEST_DIR is
    listed in the TEST_<IDX> block.

2017/09/05:

(*) MINOR: Unparsed and otherwise ignored arguments are now flagged (see
    developers guide documentation for
    ${PROJECT_NAME}_CHECK_FOR_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS).  The default value is
    'WARNING' which results in simply printing a warning but allow configure
    to complete.  This allows one to see the warnings but for the project to
    continue to work as before.  But this can be changed to 'SEND_ERROR' or
    'FATAL_ERROR' that will fail the configure.

2017/06/24:

(*) MINOR: Add new all-at-once more for CTest -S driver scripts using
    TRIBITS_CTEST_DRIVER() by setting the variable
    ${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_DO_ALL_AT_ONCE=TRUE.  This works with older versions
    of CMake/CTest and CDash but, by default, will just return a single glob
    of results, not breaking results out package-by-package.  Therefore, this
    is disabled by default and package-by-package mode is used by default.
    But if ${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_USE_NEW_AAO_FEATURES=TRUE is set, then
    TriBITS will take advantage of new CMake, CTest, and CDash features
    (currently on a branch) to display the results on CDash broken down
    package-by-package.  Once these changes are merged to the CMake/CTest and
    CDash 'master' branches, then the default for
    ${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_USE_NEW_AAO_FEATURES will be set to TRUE
    automatically when it detects an updated version of CMake/CTest is
    present.  In the future, at some point, the TriBITS default for
    ${PROJECT_NAME}_CTEST_DO_ALL_AT_ONCE will change from FALSE to TRUE since
    that is a much more efficient way to drive automated testing.

2017/05/25:

(*) MINOR: PARSE_ARGUMENTS() has been deprecated and replaced by
    CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS() everywhere in TriBITS. Any call to
    PARSE_ARGUMENTS() will warn users and tell them to use
    CMAKE_PARSE_ARGUMENTS() instead.

2017/05/17:

(*) MAJOR: TriBITS now unconditionally sets
    ${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_Fortran_DEFAULT to ON.  Projects will now need to
    put in special logic to set to OFF or ON for certain platforms.

2017/01/11:

(*) MINOR: TriBITS now correctly sets the default value for
    DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT to 1500 seconds and will scale it by
    <Project>_SCALE_TEST_TIMEOUT even if DART_TESTING_TIMEOUT is not
    explicitly set.

2016/12/07:

(*) MAJOR: The long deprecated variable
    ${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_SECONDARY_STABLE_CODE has been removed.  Upgrading
    existing TriBITS projects just requires a simple string replacement of
    _ENABLE_SECONDARY_STABLE_CODE with _ENABLE_SECONDARY_TESTED_CODE in all
    files.  Since Trilinos has turned on ST code by default and many other
    TriBITS projects don't differentiate between PT and ST code, this change
    should not even break those projects, even if they don't update.

2016/11/02:

(*) MAJOR: gitdist now accepts --dist-repos and --dist-not-repos arguments and
    requires that the base repo '.' be explicitly listed in the
    .gitdist[.default] files and in --dist-repos.  The arguments
    --dist-extra-repos, --dist-not-extra-repos and --dist-not-base-repo are
    not longer supported.  See gitdist --help for more details.

(*) MINOR: TriBITS projects now install with full RPATH set by default (see
    "Setting install RPATH" in build reference guide).

2016/10/22:

(*) MAJOR: TriBITS Core: TRIBITS_ADD_TEST() argument FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
    now works when circular RCP detection is enabled.  This is technically a
    break in backward compatibility since now that argument will not be
    ignored and any tests that specified this may change behavior.

(*) MAJOR: TriBITS Core: TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST() TEST_<IDX> argument
    FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION now works.  Before, it was just being ignored.
    This is technically a break in backward compatibility since now that
    argument will not be ignored and any tests that specified this may change
    behavior.

(*) MINOR: TriBITS Core: Added TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST() TEST_<IDX> option
    WILL_FAIL that has the same behavior as the built-in CTest option
    WILL_FAIL.

2016/01/22:

(*) MINOR: TriBITS Core: Change test category WEEKLY to HEAVY and depreciate
    WEEKLY.  You can stil use WEEKLY but it will result in a lot of warnings.

2015/12/03:

(*) MINOR: TriBITS CI Support: checkin-test.py: Added support for tracking
    branches for each repo independently and not assume 'origin' and not
    assume that all of the repos are on the same branch or will be pulling and
    pushing to the same remote branch.  This will make it easier to use the
    checkin-test.py script to set up various integration scenarios.  See
    TriBITS GitHub Issue #15 for details.

2015/04/14:

(*) MAJOR: TriBITS Core: When configuring with
    ${PROJECT_NAME}_ENABLE_CXX11=ON, if C++11 support cannot be verified, then
    the configure will fail hard right away.  Before, TriBITS would disable
    C++11 support and continue.

2014/11/22:

(*) MINOR: TriBITS Core: Added ${PROJECT_NAME}_TRACE_ADD_TEST: Now you can a
    single line print if a test got added (and its important properties if it
    did) or not and if not then why the test did not get added.

2014/09/22:

(*) MAJOR: TriBITS Core: Changed minimum version of CMake from 2.7 to 2.8.11.

2014/09/21:

(*) MINOR: TriBITS Dashboard Driver: Added support for the env var
    TRIBITS_TDD_USE_SYSTEM_CTEST so that if equal to 1, then the TriBITS
    Dashboard Driver (TDD) system will use the CTest (and CMake) in the env
    will be used instead of being downloaded using download-cmake.py.  This
    not only speeds up the auotmated builds, but it also ensures that the
    automated testing uses exactly the install of CMake/CTest that is used by
    the developers on the system.  Also, it has been found that
    download-cmake.py will download and install a 32bit version even on 64bit
    machines.

Trilinos 11.7:
--------------

(*) MINOR: TriBITS Core: Switched from the terms Primary Stable (PS) and
    Secondary Stable (SS) code to Primary Tested (PT) and Secondary Tested
    (ST) according to the plan in the TriBITS Lifecycle model.  Using 'PS' and
    'SS' is still allowed but is deprecated.  This also included deprecating
    the varible <Project>_ENABLE_SECONDARY_STABLE_CODE and replacing it with
    <Project>_ENABLE_SECONDARY_TEST_CODE.  Again, backward compatibility is
    preserved.  Also, the checkin-test.py arg --ss-extra-builds is deprecated
    and replaced with --st-extra-builds.


Trilinos 11.6:
--------------

(*) MAJOR: TriBITS Core: Changed behavior of <Project>_ENABLE_<PACKAGE>=ON to
    enable all subpackages for that package including in propogating forward
    dependencies.  See updated <Project>BuildQuickRef.* document.


Trilinos 11.3:
--------------

(*) MINOR: TriBITS Core: Added ENVIRONMENT env1=val1 env2=val2 ... argument to
    TRIBITS_ADD_TEST(), TRIBITS_ADD_ADVANCED_TEST(), and
    TRIBITS_ADD_EXECUTABLE_AND_TEST().

(*) MINOR: TriBITS Core: Fixed the generation of headers for explicit
    instantation system for subpackages: Now subpackages that use the macro
    TRIBITS_CREATE_CLIENT_TEMPLATE_HEADERS() to generate XXX.hpp header files
    with or without expliict instantation will key off of the parent package's
    explicit instantation setting.  In addition, packages that use the macro
    TRIBITS_CREATE_CLIENT_TEMPLATE_HEADERS() will also need to add a call to
    TRIBITS_ADD_EXPLICIT_INSTANTIATION_OPTION() in their top-level
    CMakeLists.txt file.
