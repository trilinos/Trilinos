# 2008/11/21: rabartl: The above function is necessary in order to
# preserve the "global" nature of the variable.  If you just call
# LIST(REMOVE_DUPLICATES ...) it will actually create a local variable
# of the same name and shadow the global variable.  It took me something
# like two hours to track down that bug!
