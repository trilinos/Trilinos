# Usage: mockprogram.py [any arguments]
#
# Mock program that takes input arguments and produces stdout by reading from
# a file .mockprogram_inout.txt in the current directory or the file specified
# by the env var MOCKPROGRAM_INOUT_FILE_OVERRIDE (which can be in any
# diretory).  This script is used to take the place of real commands during a
# test that involves calling commands on the commandline.
#
# The file .mockprogram_inout.txt (or pointed to by
# MOCKPROGRAM_INOUT_FILE_OVERRIDE) is of the form:
#
#   MOCK_PROGRAM_INPUT: <args_1>
#   MOCK_PROGRAM_RETURN: <rtn>
#   MOCK_PROGRAM_OUTPUT: <outline_1_line_1>
#   <outline_1_line_2>
#   ...
#   MOCK_PROGRAM_INPUT: <args_2>
#
# The program reads in the blocks starting at the time and removes the block
# from the file after it runs.  After all of the blocks are read in, if run
# again it will error out with error code 2.
#
# This program can be used, for example, to simulate git command.  For
# example, a couple of git commits might be simulated like:
#
#   MOCK_PROGRAM_INPUT: log -1
#   MOCK_PROGRAM_RETURN: 0
#   MOCK_PROGRAM_OUTPUT: This is the summary line
#
#   The is the body of the commit msg
#   MOCK_PROGRAM_INPUT: diff --name-only HEAD --not @{u}
#   MOCK_PROGRAM_RETURN: 0
#   MOCK_PROGRAM_OUTPUT: file_name_1.txt
#   file_name_2.txt
#   file_name_3.txt
