======================================
Submitting a TrilinosDriver dashboard:
======================================


A) Prerequisites:
=================

First, manually ensure that the following prerequisites are satisfied:

(*) python version 2.4 or later

(*) eg or git version 1.6.x or later


B) Create a base directory:
===========================

Create a directory as a base. I always use "T" in my home directory,
or "C:\T" on Windows, as the base directory. Inside there, clone the
Trilinos repository and checkout whatever branch you will be testing.

  $ cd ~    # cd \" on Windows
  $ mkdir T
  $ cd T
  $ git clone software.sandia.gov:/space/git/nightly/Trilinos

See the Trilinos developers website for instructions on how to set up
ssh so that the git clone call works using just software.sandia.gov
without a user name and without you having to type a password.


C) Create machine specific content:
===================================

Add a subdirectory named after your machine in
Trilinos/cmake/ctest/drivers. If you name the directory exactly as
your machine is named by `uname -n` then you simply need to add some
files to that directory. You can drop ".domain.gov" stuff from the end
of the machine name, as long as the name does not conflict with any
other directory names already in the drivers directory.

Add some ctest -S scripts to run as tests. You can base the *.cmake
files in this directory on those used on an existing machine that is
substantially similar to yours. If there isn't one, just copy the
files from the s903186 directory and work from there.

Add a CMakeLists.txt file to the new directory for your machine. It
should contain content something like this (from the flagship example,
s903186):

  # Initially:
  #
  TRILINOS_DRIVER_SETUP()

  # Make one of these calls for each script
  #
  TRILINOS_DRIVER_ADD_DASHBOARD(
    MPI_OPT
    ctest_mac_nightly_mpi_opt_s903186.cmake
  )

  TRILINOS_DRIVER_ADD_DASHBOARD(
    SERIAL_DEBUG
    ctest_mac_nightly_serial_debug_s903186.cmake
  )

  # Finally:
  #
  TRILINOS_ADD_REQUIRED_CMAKE_INSTALLS()

The first argument to TRILINOS_DRIVER_ADD_DASHBOARD calls is the test
name as it will appear on the TrilinosDriver dashboard. The second
argument is the name of the script in the same directory that will be
run as a ctest -S script as a test on the driver dashboard.

If you have a dashboard that must run all by itself, without any other
dashboards being run in parallel, then you should pass the RUN_SERIAL
argument.

For more details on other optional arguments, see the comments at the
function definition for TRILINOS_DRIVER_ADD_DASHBOARD in
TrilinosDriverSupport.cmake.

WARNING: The name of the build (the first argument, e.g. MPI_OPT)
should be the same as the name of the build set in the *.cmake driver
file (the second argument,
e.g. ctest_mac_nightly_mpi_opt_s903186.cmake).  There are no checks in
place to make sure that this is true.  You have been warned!

Next, add a cron_driver.sh for your machine. (Or cron_driver.bat on
Windows.)

You can set the environment variable TDD_PARALLEL_LEVEL to control how
many dashboards are run in parallel (as tests) by the TrilinosDriver
dashboard.

You may also need to set the environment variable TDD_HTTP_PROXY for
your http proxy which is needed if the script download-cmake.py can't
figure it out the proxy automatically.  For Sandia machines, this is
http://wwwproxy.sandia.gov:80/.

Typical cron_driver.sh contents:

  export TDD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=2
  export TDD_HTTP_PROXY="http://wwwproxy.sandia.gov:80/"
  ../cron_driver.py

Typical cron_driver.bat contents:

  set TDD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=2
  set TDD_HTTP_PROXY="http://wwwproxy.sandia.gov:80/"
  python "%~dp0..\cron_driver.py"


D) Run the scripts manually to test them:
=========================================

Before setting up the final cron job, you should test the individual
CTest driver scripts and the outer TrilinosDriver script.


D.1) Test out individual CTest dashboard builds first:
------------------------------------------------------

Before running your outer cron driver script, you would be wise to
first test out your individual CTest driver scripts (e.g. MPI_OPT,
SERIAL_DEBUG, etc.).  You can test individual basic ctest driver
scripts to clone Trilinos and create the BUILD directroy by creating
your own temp base directory and then overridding CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT
for example as:

  $ mkdir MOCK_MPI_OPT
  $ cd MOCK_MPI_OPT
  $ env  CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT=$PWD  Trilinos_PACKAGES=Teuchos \
     CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental \
     Trilinos_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE=Nightly CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=OFF \
     CTEST_DO_UPDATES=TRUE  CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=TRUE \
     ctest -VV -S ${TRILINOS_SRC}/cmake/ctest/drivers/s903186/ctest_mac_nightly_mpi_opt_s903186.cmake

Running the above will clone Trilinos into MOCK_MPI_OPT/Trilinos and
will create the build directory in MOCK_MPI_OPT/BUILD.  After the
initial clone is performed above, you can speed up subsequent testing by
additionally setting CTEST_DO_UPDATES=FALSE and
CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=FALSE on the environment.  You
can keep running this 'env ... ctest -S ...' command until you get
everything working.  All of the info needed to debug problems should
be present in the output from 'ctest -VV -S' (which you should pipe to
a file and then examine).

After the local CTest processes are working, just to make sure the
submit works, you can run a final trial build with:

  $ env  CTEST_DASHBOARD_ROOT=$PWD  Trilinos_PACKAGES=Teuchos \
     CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental CTEST_DO_UPDATES=FASLE \
     Trilinos_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE=Nightly \
     CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=ON CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=FALSE \
     ctest -VV -S ${TRILINOS_SRC}/cmake/ctest/drivers/s903186/ctest_mac_nightly_mpi_opt_s903186.cmake

If this submits to the 'Experimental' CDash dashbaord, you should be
in good shape for the nightly test.  If you can't find you
experimental build on the CDash dashboard, then something is wrong.


D.2) Testing the outer cron driver script:
------------------------------------------

To test this script manually, so something like:

on Linux/Mac:

  $ cd ~
  $ cd T/Trilinos/cmake/ctest/drivers/MACHINE_NAME
  $ ./cron_driver.sh

on Windows:

  $ cd \
  $ cd T\Trilinos\cmake\ctest\drivers\MACHINE_NAME
  $ cron_driver.bat

The first time you run this it *will* take a long time because it will
do a separate git clone of the Trilinos repository for each ctest
dashboard script that it runs.  In this first run, make it go faster
by setting Trilinos_PACKAGES=Teuchos and CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=FALSE on the
environment such as:

  $ cd ~
  $ cd T/Trilinos/cmake/ctest/drivers/MACHINE_NAME
  $ env  Trilinos_PACKAGES=Teuchos \
      TDD_IN_TESTING_MODE=ON \
      CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental \
      Trilinos_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE=Nightly \
      CTEST_DO_UPDATES=TRUE \
      TDD_DO_SUBMIT=FALSE \
      CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=FALSE  \
      CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES=TRUE \
      ./cron_driver.sh

Once you are done with the initial run, you can test it out
interactively in a rapid, iterative process by setting up the
following additionial environment variables:

  $ env  Trilinos_PACKAGES=Teuchos  CTEST_DO_UPDATES=FASLE \
      CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=FALSE \
      TDD_DO_SUBMIT=FALSE TDD_IN_TESTING_MODE=ON \
      CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=FALSE \
      CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental \
      Trilinos_ENABLE_KNOWN_EXTERNAL_REPOS_TYPE=Nightly \
      TDD_FORCE_CMAKE_INSTALL=0 \
      CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES=TRUE \
      ./cron_driver.sh

(of course you must use set commands on Windows).

NOTES:

(*) Set TDD_FORCE_CMAKE_INSTALL=1 to force a global CMake reinstall.
(*) Set CTEST_EXPLICITLY_ENABLE_IMPLICITLY_ENABLED_PACKAGES=FALSE if you only
    want to process the exact packages set with Trilinos_PACKAGES

Work out any kinks you may have in your environment and your scripts
by running this over and over again.

Once you are confident that your driver script is working correctly,
you should try to run this as a cron job using the command (see the
entire command below in the "cron driver" section):

  $ env  Trilinos_PACKAGES=Teuchos  CTEST_DO_SUBMIT=ON  TDD_DO_SUBMIT=ON \
      CTEST_START_WITH_EMPTY_BINARY_DIRECTORY=FALSE \
      CTEST_TEST_TYPE=Experimental \
      TDD_FORCE_CMAKE_INSTALL=1 # If you want to force outer CMake upgrade \
      ./cron_driver.sh

Note the submits variables are turned on which means that the inner
and outer submits will be performed to the Trilinos and TrilinosDriver
dashboards, respectively.  If this submits to the CDash dashboards,
you should be ready to set up your final cron job driver (see below).

WARNING: Blow away all of the base dashboard directories that get
created during this process before running the final cron job!  You
must do this so that the correct Trilinos git nightly repository will
get cloned in the inner CTest dashboards.  You would do this with:

  $ cd ~/T
  $ rm -rf MPI_DEBUG SERIAL_RELEASE ...


E) Debugging problems:
======================

Debugging the inner CTest dashbaords should be more straightforward as
descrtibed in D.1 above.

When first getting the outer TrilinosDriver script to run, there can
be problems that you will have to debug.  The output to the console
from the cron_driver.py script is very sparse but will be of some
help.  Almost all of the output from the various stages are contained
under the base build/test directory.  The base build directory for the
outer CTest TrilinosDriver script is in:

  ~/T/TDD_BUILD

You can find the output from the various configure, build, tests in
the date-specific subdirectory under:

  ~/T/TDD_BUILD/Testing/Temporary/

Note that you will also find the output from the
TrilinosCTestDriverCore.cmake script as the test output in:

  T/TDD_BUILD/Testing/Temporary/LastTest_XXX.log

Also, of course all of the output for each build case (BUILD_CASE) is
in:

  T/BUILD_CASE/Testing/Temporary/

where BUILD_CASE = MPI_OPT, SERIAL_DEBUG etc.

Good luck in debugging!


F) Set up a crontab entry (or a scheduled task on Windows):
===========================================================

After you have successfully manually testing the inner and outer
driver scripts, you will be ready to create the final crontab entry.
You can set this with 'crontab -e' or install the cron driver script
in whole.

The contents of your cron driver should look like:

  MAILTO=youremail@yourorg.org
  10 00 * * * cd  ~/T/Trilinos/cmake/ctest/drivers/MACHINE_NAME && ./cron_driver.sh &> ~/T/cron_driver.log

Typical values are MM=10 and HH=00 which starts things off at 10
minutes after midnight.  The Trilinos testing day time may move
earlier (e.g. 8 PM MST) but it will not start after Midnight so that
value is safe.  You can start your cron driver at any time after the
beginning of a new testing day (as defined by CTest/CDash
configuration).


G) Commit changes to the driver scripts:
========================================

You must commit and push changes in Trilinos/cmake/ctest/drivers into
the main Trilinos git repository.  To do this, do:

  $ cd ~/T/Trilinos
  $ eg remote add trilinos software:/space/git/Trilinos
  $ eg pull trilinos
  $ eg commit
  $ eg rebase --against trilinos/origin
  $ eg push

Hopefully, that should push your changes back and you should be ready
to let the cron job run on its own every day.  If that does not work,
cherry-pick your commits into a different local Trilinos repo cloned
directly from software:/space/git/Trilinos and do the push from there
(this is what I have had to do in the past).  Do this as:

  $ cd $SOME_OTHER_BASE/Trilinos
  $ eg remote add nighly_cdash ~/T/Trilinos
  $ eg pull nighly_cdash master
  $ eg pull
  $ eg rebase --against origin/master
  $ eg push

Of course, if you change anything other than what is in your
driver/MACHINE_NAME directory, you should use the checkin-test.py
script to test and push your commits.
