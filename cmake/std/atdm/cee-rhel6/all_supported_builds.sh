# NOTE: Above, we have commented out the 'dbg' build because it was running
# the test suite very slow and had many timeouts (see ATDV-322)

# NOTE: You have to run the CEE CUDA builds on an 'ascicgpu' machine or they
# generate binaries that don't work for the 'ascicgpu' machines.  At the same
# time, the 'ascicgpu' machines are a coveted resource so we don't want to
# waste an 'ascicgpu' machine with builds that don't even require running on
# the GPU.  So to run the non CUDA-builds, get on a CEE machine that does not
# have a GPU and to run the CUDA builds, get on an 'ascicgpu' machine.
