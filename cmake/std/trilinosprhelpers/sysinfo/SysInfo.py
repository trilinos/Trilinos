    """
    This class handles getting system information for Trilinos Pull Request
    jobs. The main thing we need to determine about the system we're running
    a PR test on is how many cores we can use in our parallel builds.

    This is generally due to the memory high-water mark required for some of
    the modules. For example, say MueLu requires 5 GB / core to effectively
    compile. We should select the # of cores we need in a parallel make to
    ensure we don't violate the high-water mark.

    One constraint we have on this class is that there are two ways to get the
    memory avilable on a system.
        1. The preferred way is to use the ``psutil`` module in Python.
        2. If ``psutil`` isn't available, we attempt to use a fall-back
           by reading in the ``/proc/meminfo`` file, which should exist
           on *nix systems.
        3. If ``psutil`` and ``/proc/meminfo`` isn't found then we will
           fail during ``import`` time by raising ``IOError``.
