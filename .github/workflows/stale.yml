          limits you can add the label `DO_NOT_AUTOCLOSE`.

          This Pull Request has been *marked for closure* due to inactivity.

          Because of the changing nature of the Trilinos source due to active
          development, a pull request with _no_ activity for **365** days is
          considered to be abandoned and will be automatically closed after **30**
          additional days of inactivity from when it was marked inactive.

          If this should be kept open, please post a comment and remove the
          label `MARKED_FOR_CLOSURE` to reset the inactivity timer.

        close-pr-message: >
          This Pull Request has been automatically closed due to **395** days of inactivity.
