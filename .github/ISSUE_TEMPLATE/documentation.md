## Documentation
Trilinos organization members, please @ mention the correct package team.  
If you are not a member, please refer to https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/wiki/Trilinos-Package-Owners to mention the correct parties (because non-members cannot mention Github teams).

What would you like to see in the documentation?  How does our current
documentation not meet your needs?  How has this lack of documentation affected
you?  What are you trying to accomplish?  What specifically must we demonstrate
to call this work complete?
