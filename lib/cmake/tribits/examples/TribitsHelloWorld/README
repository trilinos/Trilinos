This is a simple raw CMake project that is used to contrast with the raw
CMake project in ../RawHelloWorld/.

To configure this, you just create a build dir as:

$ cd $SOME_BASE_DIR
$ mkdir BUILD
$ cd BUILD

and then configure, build, and test with:

$ cmake $TRIBITS_DIR/doc/example/TribitsHelloWorld
$ make
$ ctest
