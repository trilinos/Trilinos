To get Trilinos:

Trilinos is kept in a CVS repository on skip.sandia.gov.  Contact
Paul Sery (pgsery@sandia.gov) for an account.

If you have an account on this machine, you may retrieve Trilinos by setting
the following environment variables

In csh or tcsh:

setenv CVSROOT :ext:mheroux@skip.sandia.gov:/space/CVS
setenv CVS_RSH ssh

or in bash:

export CVSROOT=:ext:mheroux@skip.sandia.gov:/space/CVS
export CVS_RSH=ssh

These variables may also be defined in your .cshrc or .bashrc file.


To build Trilinos using Autotools please see Trilinos/config/AUTOCONF_README
(Autotools has not been stabilized on all platforms)

To build Trilinos using the 'classic' make system:

1) Define the following environment variable in your .cshrc (or
   equivalent) file:

   TRILINOS_HOME - Location of the main Trilinos directory

   Please note that this is the most important variable to define.  
   All other build processes use TRILINOS_HOME as a base location to 
   point to other Trilinos makefiles and scripts.  The easiest way to 
   define TRILINOS_HOME is to put a shell define statement in your 
   .bashrc or .cshrc file.  Assume that your copy of Trilinos is in
   
   /home/mheroux/Trilinos
   
   If you are using csh, tcsh or related, put the following line in 
   your .cshrc file:
   
   setenv TRILINOS_HOME /home/mheroux/Trilinos
   
   If you are using bash, put the following line in your .bashrc file:
   
   export TRILINOS_HOME=/home/mheroux/Trilinos
   
   You may also issue these commands at the command line in the window 
   that will be used to make the Trilinos libraries.


2) cd to the build directory of the master Trilinos repository.

   All Trilinos makefiles are in the directory TRILINOS_HOME/build.  
   In particular, the target-specific makefiles that customize the build 
   for a given architecture, serial or parallel, and any other specific 
   property are defined here.  Also, the file makefile.template, which 
   serves as a template for creating a new target-specific makefile is here.

3) Determine your target for building Trilinos and create or edit the file 
   TRILINS_TARGET_DEFS and define the values of the following environment 
   variables.

   TRILINOS_ARCH - Machine architecture, e.g., SOLARIS, LINUX, SGI64
   TRILINOS_COMM - SERIAL or MPI communication.
   TRILINOS_ID   - Optional string to help differentiate unique
                   versions of the libraries. Usually unset.

   Note that as an alternative to editing the TARGET file, these variables
   can be provided as command-line arguments to gmake, e.g.,

   gmake TRILINOS_COMM=MPI

4) The Trilinos/build directory has many pre-defined target-specific
   makefiles, following the format:

   makefile.$(TRILINOS_ARCH).$(TRILINOS_COMM)$(TRILINOS_ID).

   For example, if we define (in the file TRILINOS_TARGET_DEFS):

   TRILINOS_ARCH = LINUX
   TRILINOS_COMM = SERIAL
   TRILINOS_ID = _DEBUG

   the file makefile.LINUX.SERIAL_DEBUG has the proper configuration to
   build a serial version of the Trilinos libraries on most LINUX
   platforms with proper configuration for debugging.  However, if a proper 
   target-specific makefile does not exist for your machine, copy the file 
   makefile.template to the desired target-specific makefile and edit it
   to match your machines characteristics.

5) Type "gmake".  This will start the build process.  As mentioned
   above You must have a makefile of the name
   makefile.$(TRILINOS_ARCH).$(TRILINOS_COMM)$(TRILINOS_ID) in the build
   directory.  For example there must be a file called
   makefile.SOLARIS.MPI to build an MPI version on Solaris.

   Note that the makefile.<target> file defines several values for compiler
   and compiler flags, etc., which may need to be altered for certain
   systems and platforms. Again, you may provide these variables as command-
   line arguments to gmake, or simply edit their values in makefile.<target>

   The archives that are built will be placed in the directory
   $(TRILINOS_HOME)/lib/$(TRILINOS_ARCH).$(TRILINOS_COMM)$(TRILINOS_ID)

6) Trilinos depends on several external libraries.  Some of these
   libraries are available in source form in the directory
   Trilinos/external/package_name.  For example, AztecOO depends on the
   direct sparse solver package called Y12M.  To build a version of that
   library:

   cd to the Trilinos/external/y12m directory and type gmake (again 
   making sure that the variables TRILINOS_HOME, TRILINOS_ARCH etc., 
   are provided either in the TARGET file or on the command-line) to 
   build the y12m library which many test programs in the Trilinos 
   distribution depend on.

   This will place the liby12m.a archive in the directory
   $(TRILINOS_HOME)/external/y12m/lib/$(TRILINOS_ARCH).$(TRILINOS_COMM)$(TRILINOS_ID)

7) You can build individual Trilinos components by typing
   gmake component_name, e.g., gmake epetra

8) "gmake clean" will delete object files.  You may need to do a gmake
   clean to do a make of a partially built library.

9) "gmake clobber" will delete object files and libraries.


10) To clean or clobber an individual library, type 

    gmake clean_component_name
    gmake clobber_component_name

For example:

    gmake clean_epetra


11) Most Trilinos components have unit tests and example drivers that
    can be very useful to someone getting familiar with Trilinos.  These
    drivers are found in the individual package or adaptor directories
    under test or example.  For example, the Epetra unit tests are in 
    Trilinos/packages/epetra/test.  Epetra examples are in
    Trilinos/packages/epetra/example.
