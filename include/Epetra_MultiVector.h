//! Epetra_MultiVector: A class for constructing and using dense multi-vectors, vectors and matrices in parallel.

/*! The Epetra_MultiVector class enables the construction and use of real-valued,
  double-precision dense vectors, multi-vectors,
  and matrices in a distributed memory environment.  The dimensions and distribution of the dense
  multi-vectors is determined in part by a Epetra_Comm object, a Epetra_Map (or Epetra_LocalMap
  or Epetra_BlockMap) and the number of vectors passed to the constructors described below.

  There are several concepts that important for understanding the Epetra_MultiVector class:

  <ul>
  <li>  Multi-vectors, Vectors and Matrices.
  <ul>
  <li> Vector - A list of real-valued, double-precision numbers.  Also a multi-vector with one vector.
  <li> Multi-Vector - A collection of one or more vectors, all having the same length and distribution.
  <li> (Dense) Matrix - A special form of multi-vector such that stride in memory between any
  two consecutive vectors in the multi-vector is the same for all vectors.  This is identical
  to a two-dimensional array in Fortran and plays an important part in high performance
  computations.
  </ul>
  <li> Distributed Global vs. Replicated Local.
  <ul>
  <li> Distributed Global Multi-vectors - In most instances, a multi-vector will be partitioned
  across multiple memory images associated with multiple processors.  In this case, there is
  a unique copy of each element and elements are spread across all processors specified by
  the Epetra_Comm communicator.
  <li> Replicated Local Multi-vectors - Some algorithms use multi-vectors that are too small to
  be distributed across all processors, the Hessenberg matrix in a GMRES
  computation.  In other cases, such as with block iterative methods,  block dot product
  functions produce small
  dense matrices that are required by all processors.  Replicated local multi-vectors handle
  these types of situation.
  </ul>
  <li> Multi-vector Functions vs. Dense Matrix Functions.
  <ul>
  <li> Multi-vector functions - These functions operate simultaneously but independently
  on each vector in the multi-vector and produce individual results for each vector.
  <li> Dense matrix functions - These functions operate on the multi-vector as a matrix,
  providing access to selected dense BLAS and LAPACK operations.
  </ul>
  </ul>

  <b>Constructing Epetra_MultiVectors</b>

  Except for the basic constructor and copy constructor, Epetra_MultiVector constructors
  have two data access modes:
  <ol>
  <li> Copy mode - Allocates memory and makes a copy of the user-provided data. In this case, the
  user data is not needed after construction.
  <li> View mode - Creates a "view" of the user data. In this case, the
  user data is required to remain intact for the life of the multi-vector.
  </ol>

  \warning View mode is \e extremely dangerous from a data hiding perspective.
  Therefore, we strongly encourage users to develop code using Copy mode first and
  only use the View mode in a secondary optimization phase.

  All Epetra_MultiVector constructors require a map argument that describes the layout of elements
  on the parallel machine.  Specifically,
  \c map is a Epetra_Map, Epetra_LocalMap or Epetra_BlockMap object describing the desired
  memory layout for the multi-vector.

  There are six different Epetra_MultiVector constructors:
  <ul>
  <li> Basic - All values are zero.
  <li> Copy - Copy an existing multi-vector.
  <li> Copy from or make view of two-dimensional Fortran style array.
  <li> Copy from or make view of an array of pointers.
  <li> Copy or make view of a list of vectors from another Epetra_MultiVector object.
  <li> Copy or make view of a range of vectors from another Epetra_MultiVector object.
  </ul>

  <b>Extracting Data from Epetra_MultiVectors</b>

  Once a Epetra_MultiVector is constructed, it is possible to extract a copy of the values or create
  a view of them.

  \warning ExtractView functions are \e extremely dangerous from a data hiding perspective.
  For both ExtractView fuctions, there is a corresponding ExtractCopy function.  We
  strongly encourage users to develop code using ExtractCopy functions first and
  only use the ExtractView functions in a secondary optimization phase.

  There are four Extract functions:
  <ul>
  <li> ExtractCopy - Copy values into a user-provided two-dimensional array.
  <li> ExtractCopy - Copy values into a user-provided array of pointers.
  <li> ExtractView - Set user-provided two-dimensional array parameters
  to point to Epetra_MultiVector data.
  <li> ExtractView - Set user-provided array of pointer parameters
  to point to Epetra_MultiVector data.
  </ul>

  <b>Vector, Matrix and Utility Functions</b>

  Once a Epetra_MultiVector is constructed, a variety of mathematical functions can be applied to
  the individual vectors.  Specifically:
  <ul>
  <li> Dot Products.
  <li> Vector Updates.
  <li> \e p Norms.
  <li> Weighted Norms.
  <li> Minimum, Maximum and Average Values.
  </ul>

  In addition, a matrix-matrix multiply function supports a variety of operations on any viable
  combination of global distributed and local replicated multi-vectors using calls to DGEMM, a
  high performance kernel for matrix operations.  In the near future we will add support for calls
  to other selected BLAS and LAPACK functions.

  <b> Counting Floating Point Operations </b>

  Each Epetra_MultiVector object keep track of the number
  of \e serial floating point operations performed using the specified object as the \e this argument
  to the function.  The Flops() function returns this number as a double precision number.  Using this
  information, in conjunction with the Epetra_Time class, one can get accurate parallel performance
  numbers.  The ResetFlops() function resets the floating point counter.

  \warning A Epetra_Map, Epetra_LocalMap or Epetra_BlockMap object is required for all
  Epetra_MultiVector constructors.
