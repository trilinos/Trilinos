//! Ifpack_CrsRiluk: A class for constructing and using an incomplete lower/upper (ILU) factorization of a given Epetra_RowMatrix.

/*! The Ifpack_CrsRiluk class computes a "Relaxed" ILU factorization with level k fill
    of a given Epetra_CrsMatrix.  The factorization
    that is produced is a function of several parameters:
<ol>
  <li> The pattern of the matrix - All fill is derived from the original matrix nonzero structure.  Level zero fill
       is defined as the original matrix pattern (nonzero structure), even if the matrix value at an entry is stored
       as a zero. (Thus it is possible to add entries to the ILU factors by adding zero entries the original matrix.)

  <li> Level of fill - Starting with the original matrix pattern as level fill of zero, the next level of fill is
       determined by analyzing the graph of the previous level and determining nonzero fill that is a result of combining
       entries that were from previous level only (not the current level).  This rule limits fill to entries that
       are direct decendents from the previous level graph.  Fill for level k is determined by applying this rule
       recursively.  For sufficiently large values of k, the fill would eventually be complete and an exact LU
       factorization would be computed.  Level of fill is defined during the construction of the Ifpack_IlukGraph object.

  <li> Level of overlap - All Ifpack preconditioners work on parallel distributed memory computers by using
       the row partitioning the user input matrix to determine the partitioning for local ILU factors.  If the level of
       overlap is set to zero,
       the rows of the user matrix that are stored on a given processor are treated as a self-contained local matrix
       and all column entries that reach to off-processor entries are ignored.  Setting the level of overlap to one
       tells Ifpack to increase the size of the local matrix by adding rows that are reached to by rows owned by this
       processor.  Increasing levels of overlap are defined recursively in the same way.  For sufficiently large levels
       of overlap, the entire matrix would be part of each processor's local ILU factorization process.
       Level of overlap is defined during the construction of the Ifpack_IlukGraph object.

       Once the factorization is computed, applying the factorization \(LUy = x\)
       results in redundant approximations for any elements of y that correspond to
       rows that are part of more than one local ILU factor.  The OverlapMode (changed by calling SetOverlapMode())
       defines how these redundancies are
       handled using the Epetra_CombineMode enum.  The default is to zero out all values of y for rows that
       were not part of the original matrix row distribution.

  <li> Fraction of relaxation - Ifpack_CrsRiluk computes the ILU factorization row-by-row.  As entries at a given
       row are computed, some number of them will be dropped because they do match the prescribed sparsity pattern.
       The relaxation factor determines how these dropped values will be handled.  If the RelaxValue (changed by calling
       SetRelaxValue()) is zero, then these extra entries will by dropped.  This is a classical ILU approach.
       If the RelaxValue is 1, then the sum
       of the extra entries will be added to the diagonal.  This is a classical Modified ILU (MILU) approach.  If
       RelaxValue is between 0 and 1, then RelaxValue times the sum of extra entries will be added to the diagonal.

       For most situations, RelaxValue should be set to zero.  For certain kinds of problems, e.g., reservoir modeling,
       there is a conservation principle involved such that any operator should obey a zero row-sum property.  MILU
       was designed for these cases and you should set the RelaxValue to 1.  For other situations, setting RelaxValue to
       some nonzero value may improve the stability of factorization, and can be used if the computed ILU factors
       are poorly conditioned.

  <li> Diagonal perturbation - Prior to computing the factorization, it is possible to modify the diagonal entries of the matrix
       for which the factorization will be computing.  If the absolute and relative perturbation values are zero and one,
       respectively, the
       factorization will be compute for the original user matrix A.  Otherwise, the factorization
       will computed for a matrix that differs from the original user matrix in the diagonal values only.  Below we discuss
       the details of diagonal perturbations.
       The absolute and relative threshold values are set by calling SetAbsoluteThreshold() and SetRelativeThreshold(), respectively.
</ol>

<b> Estimating Preconditioner Condition Numbers </b>

For ill-conditioned matrices, we often have difficulty computing usable incomplete
factorizations.  The most common source of problems is that the factorization may encounter a small or zero pivot,
in which case the factorization can fail, or even if the factorization
succeeds, the factors may be so poorly conditioned that use of them in
the iterative phase produces meaningless results.  Before we can fix
this problem, we must be able to detect it.  To this end, we use a
simple but effective condition number estimate for \f$(LU)^{-1}\f$.

The condition of a matrix \f$B\f$, called \f$cond_p(B)\f$, is defined as
\f$cond_p(B) = \|B\|_p\|B^{-1}\|_p\f$ in some appropriate norm \f$p\f$.  \f$cond_p(B)\f$
gives some indication of how many accurate floating point
digits can be expected from operations involving the matrix and its
inverse.  A condition number approaching the accuracy of a given
floating point number system, about 15 decimal digits in IEEE double
precision, means that any results involving \f$B\f$ or \f$B^{-1}\f$ may be
meaningless.

The \f$\infty\f$-norm of a vector \f$y\f$ is defined as the maximum of the
absolute values of the vector entries, and the \f$\infty\f$-norm of a
matrix C is defined as
\f$\|C\|_\infty = \max_{\|y\|_\infty = 1} \|Cy\|_\infty\f$.
A crude lower bound for the \f$cond_\infty(C)\f$ is
\f$\|C^{-1}e\|_\infty\f$ where \f$e = (1, 1, \ldots, 1)^T\f$.  It is a
lower bound because \f$cond_\infty(C) = \|C\|_\infty\|C^{-1}\|_\infty
\ge \|C^{-1}\|_\infty \ge |C^{-1}e\|_\infty\f$.

For our purposes, we want to estimate \f$cond_\infty(LU)\f$, where \f$L\f$ and
\f$U\f$ are our incomplete factors.  Edmond in his Ph.D. thesis demonstrates that
\f$\|(LU)^{-1}e\|_\infty\f$ provides an effective estimate for
\f$cond_\infty(LU)\f$.  Furthermore, since finding \f$z\f$ such that \f$LUz = y\f$
is a basic kernel for applying the preconditioner, computing this
estimate of \f$cond_\infty(LU)\f$ is performed by setting \f$y = e\f$, calling
the solve kernel to compute \f$z\f$ and then
computing \f$\|z\|_\infty\f$.


<b>\e A \e priori Diagonal Perturbations</b>

Given the above method to estimate the conditioning of the incomplete factors,
if we detect that our factorization is too ill-conditioned
we can improve the conditioning by perturbing the matrix diagonal and
restarting the factorization using
this more diagonally dominant matrix.  In order to apply perturbation,
prior to starting
the factorization, we compute a diagonal perturbation of our matrix
\f$A\f$ and perform the factorization on this perturbed
matrix.  The overhead cost of perturbing the diagonal is minimal since
the first step in computing the incomplete factors is to copy the
matrix \f$A\f$ into the memory space for the incomplete factors.  We
simply compute the perturbed diagonal at this point.

The actual perturbation values we use are the diagonal values \f$(d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_n)\f$
with \f$d_i = sgn(d_i)\alpha + d_i\rho\f$, \f$i=1, 2, \ldots, n\f$, where
\f$n\f$ is the matrix dimension and \f$sgn(d_i)\f$ returns
the sign of the diagonal entry.  This has the effect of
forcing the diagonal values to have minimal magnitude of \f$\alpha\f$ and
to increase each by an amount proportional to \f$\rho\f$, and still keep
the sign of the original diagonal entry.

<b>Constructing Ifpack_CrsRiluk objects</b>

Constructing Ifpack_CrsRiluk objects is a multi-step process.  The basic steps are as follows:
<ol>
  <li> Create Ifpack_CrsRiluk instance, including storage,  via constructor.
  <li> Enter values via one or more Put or SumInto functions.
  <li> Complete construction via FillComplete call.
</ol>

Note that, even after a matrix is constructed, it is possible to update existing matrix entries.  It is \e not possible to
create new entries.

<b> Counting Floating Point Operations </b>

Each Ifpack_CrsRiluk object keep track of the number
of \e serial floating point operations performed using the specified object as the \e this argument
to the function.  The Flops() function returns this number as a double precision number.  Using this
information, in conjunction with the Epetra_Time class, one can get accurate parallel performance
numbers.  The ResetFlops() function resets the floating point counter.

\warning A Epetra_Map is required for the Ifpack_CrsRiluk constructor.
