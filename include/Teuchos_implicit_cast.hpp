 *
 * This function will only compile for types where an implicit conversion from
 * objects of type <tt>TypeFrom</tt> to type <tt>TypeTo</tt> exists.  Note
 * that this is a weaker operation than a <tt>static_cast<TypeTo>(t)</tt> in
 * that the static cast will actually compile in cases where the implicit
 * conversion would not compile and may result in incorrect code.  This
 * function can not result in incorrect code, assuming that the implicit
 * conversions themselves do no result in incorrect code (which is another
 * matter all together).
 *
 * This function is especially helpful when one needs to be careful of what
 * specific type is passed in as a formal argument to a function and in
 * comparing values.  In particular, using this function is far safer than
 * using <tt>TypeTo(t)</tt> in cases where <tt>TypeTo</tt> is a built in type
 * since <tt>TypeTo(t)</tt> in these cases is equivalent to <tt>(TypeTo)t</tt>
 * which is an unchecked sledge-hammer cast of the worst kind.
