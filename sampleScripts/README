This directory contains sample scripts for configuring Trilinos.
"Configuring" Trilinos prepares it for building (running "make" to
compile and link it).  Trilinos uses CMake for its configuration
process.

This directory has three different kinds of scripts:

  1. Scripts that run CMake to set up a single Trilinos build.
     If you are a Trilinos user, this is probably what you want.

  2. Scripts for running Trilinos' check-in tests, with multiple
     builds.  These all have "checkin-test-" in their name.  If you
     are a Trilinos developer, this is what you want.

  3. *.cmake files, that help set up specific Dashboard tests.
     These are for expert Trilinos developers and framework staff.
